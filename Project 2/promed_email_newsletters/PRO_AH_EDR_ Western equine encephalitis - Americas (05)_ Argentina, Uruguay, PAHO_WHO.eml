Epidemiological Update -- Western Equine Encephalitis in the Region of
the Americas
---------------------------------------------------------------------------=
-----

Summary of the situation
------------------------
On 19 Dec 2023, the Pan American Health Organization/World Health
Organization (PAHO/WHO) warned about the risk to human health
associated with the circulation of the western equine encephalitis
virus (WEE) (1). From that date until 9 Jan 2024, 374 additional
outbreaks (equine outbreak: occurrence of one or more cases of WEE in
equines) in animals were reported (338 in Argentina and 36 in Uruguay)
and 21 human cases, all of them in Argentina (2-6).

Cases in animals
----------------
In Argentina, from 25 Nov 2023 to 9 Jan 2024, the National Food Safety
and Quality Service (SENASA as per its acronym in Spanish) confirmed
1258 outbreaks [equine cases] (40 diagnosed by laboratory and 1218 by
clinical and epidemiology) which are registered in 15 provinces:
Buenos Aires, Catamarca, Chaco, Corrientes, C=F3rdoba, Entre R=EDos,
Formosa, La Pampa, La Rioja, Mendoza, R=EDo Negro, Santa Fe, San Luis,
Santiago del Estero and Salta. The highest proportion of cases in
animals was recorded in the province of Buenos Aires, which accounts
for 60% of confirmed cases (2,6).

In Uruguay, from 5 Dec 2023 to 9 Jan 2024, the Ministry of Livestock,
Agriculture and Fisheries (MGAP as per its acronym in Spanish)
confirmed 56 cases in equines in 15 departments of the country:
Artigas, Canelones, Durazno, Flores, Lavalleja, Montevideo, Paysand=FA,
R=EDo Negro, Rivera, Rocha, Salto, San Jos=E9, Soriano, Tacuaremb=F3 and
Treinta y Tres. The highest proportion of cases was recorded in the
department of Paysand=FA, which accounts for 23% of confirmed cases
(4).

Human WEE cases
---------------
In Argentina, a human case of western equine encephalitis was reported
in the country on 20 Dec 2023, after more than 2 decades without
reported cases. The case corresponds to a 32-year-old man, a rural
worker, resident of the province of Santa Fe, who presented the onset
of symptoms on 19 Nov [2023] (headache, myalgia, dizziness,
disorientation, and sudden onset fever). On 24 Nov [2023], he received
medical attention at a public health facility in the province. He
required intensive care and mechanical ventilation for 12 days and was
discharged on 20 Dec 2023 (3,5,7).

In addition, and as a result of the active search up to
epidemiological week (EW) 52, 91 suspected cases were reported in 11
provinces, of which 21 were laboratory-confirmed, including one death.
The confirmed cases come from the provinces of Buenos Aires (n =3D 11),
Santa F=E9 (n =3D 8), Entre R=EDos (n =3D 1) and Santiago del Estero (n =3D=
 1)
(Figure 1 and Figure 2) (5,7).

Figure 2 [map]. Geographic distribution by locality of exposure of
confirmed cases of WEE in humans [in] Argentina by symptom onset EW*
and eco-regions, up to EW 1 of 2024.

Regarding the distribution of cases by epidemiological week, 71% of
cases occurred between EW 49 and 51 of 2023. The first case occurred
in EW 46, with one fatal case in EW 48 (Figure 3) (7).

Figure 3 [graph]. Distribution of confirmed cases of WEE by EW of
symptom onset. EW 46 of 2023 to EW 1 of 2024, Argentina

Of the cases 90% were male (n =3D 19). The age range is from 9 months to
75 years, with the highest proportion of cases in the group over 60
years of age, with 33% (n =3D 7), followed by the group between 50 and
59 years of age with 29% (n =3D 6) (Figure 4) (7).

Figure 4 [graph]. Distribution of WEE cases by age and sex, up to EW 1
of 2024, Argentina.

Regarding the reported symptoms, 86% had sudden onset fever (n =3D 18),
76% headache (n =3D 16), 52% vomiting (n =3D 11), 48% mental confusion (n
=3D 10), 43% drowsiness (n =3D 9), 38% other neurological manifestations
(n =3D 8), 38% myalgias (n =3D 8), 19% tremors (n =3D 4), 14% had
prostration (n =3D 3) and 14% reported no symptoms (n =3D 3) (Figure 5)
(7).

Figure 5 [graph]. Distribution of symptoms presented in confirmed
cases of WEE in humans, up to EW 1 2024, Argentina.

In all cases, confirmation was made through specific neutralizing
antibodies in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples. All
confirmed cases required hospitalization, of these, 8 required care in
intensive care unit and 13 in general hospitalization. To date, 9
cases have been discharged, 11 remain hospitalized and 1 has died. The
fatal case corresponds to a 66-year-old man, with a previous diagnosis
of diabetes, resident of the rural area in the province of Santa Fe,
who onset symptoms on 26 Nov 2023 and died on 22 Dec 2023 (7).

Regarding the history of exposure, in the cases for which this
information is available (n =3D 7), 3 correspond to people who work as
veterinarians, 2 construction workers, and 2 reported having carried
out outdoor recreational activities (7).

No human cases have been reported in Uruguay to date. The last human
case of WEE reported in Uruguay was in 2009 (8).

Figure 6 shows that the distribution of cases in humans is recorded in
areas of Argentina with the highest number of suspected and confirmed
cases in animals (2,4,6).

Recommendations
---------------
On 19 Dec 2023, the Pan American Health Organization/World Health
Organization (PAHO/WHO) issued an epidemiological alert on the risk to
human health associated with the circulation of this virus and the
high potential for spread to other countries in the Region of the
Americas; alerting Member States to the importance of strengthening
epidemiological surveillance and diagnosis of equine encephalitis,
intersectoral coordination, surveillance and vector control in the
Region (1).

Below is a summary of the main recommendations for diagnosis,
surveillance, prevention measures, and risk communication.

Laboratory diagnosis of WEE in humans (9)
-----------------------------------------
The diagnosis of WEEV infection requires confirmation through
laboratory techniques since the clinical presentation is not specific.
These laboratory methods include virological (direct) diagnostic
methods by nucleic acid amplification or potentially cell culture and
serological (indirect) methods, which aim at detecting antibodies
produced against the virus. Generally, samples for diagnosis include
serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). CSF should only be collected in
cases with neurological symptoms and by clinical indication.

Biosafety
---------
Fresh biological samples, of any type, should be considered
potentially infectious. Samples should be processed and handled
exclusively by trained professionals after a local risk assessment,
considering all biosafety indications and appropriate personal
protective equipment. Any procedure involving sample manipulation
should be conducted in certified Class II biosafety cabinets. The
manipulation of extracted RNA does not require biosafety cabinets.
Additionally, all necessary precautions should be taken to prevent
percutaneous exposure. The manipulation of materials or cultures with
high viral load and/or high volume should be considered only after a
local risk assessment considering the necessary containment measures
is conducted.

Virological methods
-------------------
The detection of viral RNA can be performed on serum and CSF samples
using real-time or endpoint RT-PCR with specific primers (and probes)
for WEEV. Generic protocols (pan-alphavirus) can also be used,
followed by specific RT-PCR or nucleotide sequencing.

Viral isolation is carried out using the same types of samples as
RT-PCR. Mammalian cell lines (e.g., Vero cells) and mosquito cells
(e.g., C6/36 cells) are used. In general, viral isolation is not
routinely applied nor is it a requirement for diagnostic confirmation.
Technical complexity, containment requirements, costs, as well as the
need to identify isolated viruses by RT-PCR or immunofluorescence,
limit the use and timeliness of the diagnosis by viral isolation. In
fatal cases, RT-PCR (or viral isolation) can also be performed on
tissue samples (in particular, nervous system tissue).

A positive result by RT-PCR (or viral isolation) confirms the
infection. However, viremia in WEEV infections is low and of short
duration. Furthermore, if the case is detected in the neurological
phase, the virus is likely no longer present in the blood. Therefore,
a negative result does not rule out infection and, in cases of
clinical and epidemiological suspicion, serological methods should be
used. Differential diagnosis by molecular methods, particularly for
other arboviruses that can cause neurological syndromes, should also
be considered. Depending on the epidemiological situation, other
viruses such as Eastern Equine Encephalitis (EEE) and Venezuelan
Equine Encephalitis (VEE) could be considered as well as neurotropic
flaviviruses (e.g. West Nile virus, St. Louis encephalitis virus)
could be considered (Figure 7).

While RT-PCR generally has a low sensitivity due to the [low] level
and duration of viremia (it may be possible to detect the viral RNA up
to 3 days after the onset of symptoms, at most 5 days), its high
specificity and fast turnaround make it an important tool in the
detecting WEEV infections. In an outbreak context with compatible
symptoms, detection by RT-PCR in at least one case allows for the
identification of the etiological agent.

Serological methods
-------------------
IgM antibody detection is performed by ELISA using in-house
methodologies. Detection can be performed in both serum and CSF. The
kinetics of antibody production have not been fully described.
However, it is likely that antibody detection can be performed early
after the onset of symptoms, particularly neurological ones (Figure
7).=20

Antibody detection may be limited by potential cross-reactivity
between WEEV and other alphaviruses; therefore, in cases with clinical
and epidemiological suspicion, a positive result for IgM is considered
a probable case of WEEV infection. Nevertheless, the specificity of
IgM detection is estimated to be relatively high.

The potential cross-reactivity can be assessed by conducting
differential IgM serological tests for other alphaviruses,
particularly chikungunya (CHIKV), always taking into account the
epidemiological context. In cases of positivity to more than one
alphavirus, additional clinical and epidemiological criteria should be
used for the final interpretation of the case. Cases of
cross-reactivity can also be evaluated by neutralization assays such
as the plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) or
microneutralization, ideally using paired samples (acute and
convalescent samples collected with more than 7-10 days of difference,
convalescent sample collected more than 14 days after the onset of
symptoms). Depending on the epidemiological situation in the area
where the infection likely happened, it is recommended to detect in
parallel neutralizing antibodies against WEEV, EEEV, VEEV, CHIKV and
Mayaro (MAYV) (Figure 7). Finally, the detection of specific
antibodies in CSF confirms WEEV infection in a case with neurological
manifestations.

Sample storage
--------------
- Serum and CSF samples:
*Keep refrigerated (2-8=B0C) if processed (or sent to a reference
laboratory) within 48 hours.
*Keep frozen (-10 to -20=B0C) if processed after 48 hours or within 7
days.
*Keep frozen (-70=B0C or less) if processed more than 1 week after
collection. The sample is adequately preserved at -70=B0C for extended
periods of time.
- Tissue samples: freeze and ship on dry ice.
- Avoid multiple freeze-thaw cycles.

Equine Encephalitis (WEE) virus infection.

Human case surveillance
-----------------------
In areas at risk or with active outbreaks, it is recommended to
implement or strengthen surveillance through the search for compatible
neurological syndromes that do not have another defined diagnosis,
taking into account the incubation period, geographical area and
environmental conditions.

Patient management and infection prevention measures in health
facilities
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
There is no specific antiviral treatment. Most infections are
characterized by a mild clinical presentation in which treatment is
symptomatic. Patients presenting with neurologic symptoms should be
evaluated by a specialist and require close monitoring.

Prevention measures
-------------------
The preventive actions listed below must be organized within the
framework of One Health, considering the inter-institutional and
comprehensive action between animal health, human health, and the
environment.

Managing the environment
------------------------
Considering the ecology and biology of the main vectors of the WEE
virus, the main prevention measure is the modification of the
environment and the environmental management of the environment,
seeking to reduce the number of mosquitoes and their contact with
equids and humans. These measures include:
- Filling or draining water collections, ponds, or temporary flooding
sites that may serve as sites of female oviposition and breeding sites
for mosquito larvae.
- Elimination of weeds around the premises to reduce mosquito resting
and shelter sites.
- The equids can be protected by sheltering them in barns with
mosquito nets, especially at times when mosquitoes are most active.
- Avoid gatherings and movements of horses at fairs, sporting events,
and similar activities.
- Despite the fact that the main vectors do not have indoor habits, it
is advisable to protect homes with mosquito nets on doors and windows;
in this way other arboviruses are also prevented.

Vector control
--------------
Vector control measures for WEE should be considered within the
framework of Integrated Vector Management (IVM). It is important to
consider that the decision to carry out vector control activities with
insecticides depends on entomological surveillance data and the
variables that may condition an increase in the risk of transmission,
including insecticide resistance data.
- Insecticide spraying may be considered as an additional measure and,
where technically feasible, in areas of transmission where high
mosquito populations are detected. The methodology should be
established based on the ecology and behavior of the local vectors.

Vaccination for equids
----------------------
Vaccines are available for equids. It is advisable to seek high
vaccination coverage in susceptible equids in areas considered at risk
and to carry out annual vaccination boosters in these equines.

Personal protective measures
----------------------------
- Use of clothing that covers the legs and arms, especially in homes
where someone is sick.
- Use of repellents containing DEET, IR3535 or Icaridin, which may be
applied to exposed skin or clothing; their use must be in strict
accordance with the instructions on the product label.
- Use wire mesh/mosquito netting on doors and windows.
- Use of insecticide-treated or non-insecticide nets for daytime
sleepers (e.g., pregnant women, infants, bedridden, elderly, and night
shift workers).
- During outbreaks, outdoor activities should be avoided during the
mosquitoes' peak feeding period (dawn and dusk).

[The above report provides a broad overview and an update of the WEE
human and equine outbreak in Argentina and reports the equine cases in
Uruguay. Readers interested in seeing the figures cited in the above
text can access them at the source URL. The report makes a strong case
for the need for a holistic, One Health approach in dealing with
outbreaks like this one. Although there are comments about mosquito
vectors and the need to consider the ecology and biology of the main
vectors of the WEE virus in order to control them, it is curious that
the species of mosquitoes transmitting WEE virus in this outbreak are
not mentioned in the review above or in the previous reports that have
come to ProMED. If in fact mosquito surveillance is being carried out
with detection of virus in them, ProMED would be interested in these
findings. - Mod.TY

 in the Region of the<br>Americas; alerting Member States to the importance=
 of strengthening<br>epidemiological surveillance and diagnosis of equine e=
ncephalitis,<br>intersectoral coordination, surveillance and vector control=
 in the<br>Region (1).=0D<br>=0D<br>Below is a summary of the main recommen=
dations for diagnosis,<br>surveillance, prevention measures, and risk commu=
nication.=0D<br>=0D<br>Laboratory diagnosis of WEE in humans (9)=0D<br>----=
-------------------------------------=0D<br>The diagnosis of WEEV infection=
 requires confirmation through<br>laboratory techniques since the clinical =
presentation is not specific.<br>These laboratory methods include virologic=
al (direct) diagnostic<br>methods by nucleic acid amplification or potentia=
lly cell culture and<br>serological (indirect) methods, which aim at detect=
ing antibodies<br>produced against the virus. Generally, samples for diagno=
sis include<br>serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). CSF should only be coll=
ected in<br>cases with neurological symptoms and by clinical indication.=0D=
<br>=0D<br>Biosafety=0D<br>---------=0D<br>Fresh biological samples, of any=
 type, should be considered<br>potentially infectious. Samples should be pr=
ocessed and handled<br>exclusively by trained professionals after a local r=
isk assessment,<br>considering all biosafety indications and appropriate pe=
rsonal<br>protective equipment. Any procedure involving sample manipulation=
<br>should be conducted in certified Class II biosafety cabinets. The<br>ma=
nipulation of extracted RNA does not require biosafety cabinets.<br>Additio=
nally, all necessary precautions should be taken to prevent<br>percutaneous=
 exposure. The manipulation of materials or cultures with<br>high viral loa=
d and/or high volume should be considered only after a<br>local risk assess=
ment considering the necessary containment measures<br>is conducted.=0D<br>=0D=
<br>Virological methods=0D<br>-------------------=0D<br>The detection of vi=
ral RNA can be performed on serum and CSF samples<br>using real-time or end=
point RT-PCR with specific primers (and probes)<br>for WEEV. Generic protoc=
ols (pan-alphavirus) can also be used,<br>followed by specific RT-PCR or nu=
cleotide sequencing.=0D<br>=0D<br>Viral isolation is carried out using the =
same types of samples as<br>RT-PCR. Mammalian cell lines (e.g., Vero cells)=
 and mosquito cells<br>(e.g., C6/36 cells) are used. In general, viral isol=
ation is not<br>routinely applied nor is it a requirement for diagnostic co=
nfirmation.<br>Technical complexity, containment requirements, costs, as we=
ll as the<br>need to identify isolated viruses by RT-PCR or immunofluoresce=
nce,<br>limit the use and timeliness of the diagnosis by viral isolation. I=
n<br>fatal cases, RT-PCR (or viral isolation) can also be performed on<br>t=
issue samples (in particular, nervous system tissue).=0D<br>=0D<br>A positi=
ve result by RT-PCR (or viral isolation) confirms the<br>infection. However=
, viremia in WEEV infections is low and of short<br>duration. Furthermore, =
if the case is detected in the neurological<br>phase, the virus is likely n=
o longer present in the blood. Therefore,<br>a negative result does not rul=
e out infection and, in cases of<br>clinical and epidemiological suspicion,=
 serological methods should be<br>used. Differential diagnosis by molecular=
 methods, particularly for<br>other arboviruses that can cause neurological=
 syndromes, should also<br>be considered. Depending on the epidemiological =
situation, other<br>viruses such as Eastern Equine Encephalitis (EEE) and V=
enezuelan<br>Equine Encephalitis (VEE) could be considered as well as neuro=
tropic<br>flaviviruses (e.g. West Nile virus, St. Louis encephalitis virus)=
<br>could be considered (Figure 7).=0D<br>=0D<br>While RT-PCR generally has=
 a low sensitivity due to the [low] level<br>and duration of viremia (it ma=
y be possible to detect the viral RNA up<br>to 3 days after the onset of sy=
mptoms, at most 5 days), its high<br>specificity and fast turnaround make i=
t an important tool in the<br>detecting WEEV infections. In an outbreak con=
text with compatible<br>symptoms, detection by RT-PCR in at least one case =
allows for the<br>identification of the etiological agent.=0D<br>=0D<br>Ser=
ological methods=0D<br>-------------------=0D<br>IgM antibody detection is =
performed by ELISA using in-house<br>methodologies. Detection can be perfor=
med in both serum and CSF. The<br>kinetics of antibody production have not =
been fully described.<br>However, it is likely that antibody detection can =
be performed early<br>after the onset of symptoms, particularly neurologica=
l ones (Figure<br>7).=20=0D<br>=0D<br>Antibody detection may be limited by =
potential cross-reactivity<br>between WEEV and other alphaviruses; therefor=
e, in cases with clinical<br>and epidemiological suspicion, a positive resu=
lt for IgM is considered<br>a probable case of WEEV infection. Nevertheless=
, the specificity of<br>IgM detection is estimated to be relatively high.=0D=
<br>=0D<br>The potential cross-reactivity can be assessed by conducting<br>=
differential IgM serological tests for other alphaviruses,<br>particularly =
chikungunya (CHIKV), always taking into account the<br>epidemiological cont=
ext. In cases of positivity to more than one<br>alphavirus, additional clin=
ical and epidemiological criteria should be<br>used for the final interpret=
ation of the case. Cases of<br>cross-reactivity can also be evaluated by ne=
utralization assays such<br>as the plaque reduction neutralization test (PR=
NT) or<br>microneutralization, ideally using paired samples (acute and<br>c=
onvalescent samples collected with more than 7-10 days of difference,<br>co=
nvalescent sample collected more than 14 days after the onset of<br>symptom=
s). Depending on the epidemiological situation in the area<br>where the inf=
ection likely happened, it is recommended to detect in<br>parallel neutrali=
zing antibodies against WEEV, EEEV, VEEV, CHIKV and<br>Mayaro (MAYV) (Figur=
e 7). Finally, the detection of specific<br>antibodies in CSF confirms WEEV=
 infection in a case with neurological<br>manifestations.=0D<br>=0D<br>Samp=
le storage=0D<br>--------------=0D<br>- Serum and CSF samples:=0D<br>*Keep =
refrigerated (2-8=B0C) if processed (or sent to a reference<br>laboratory) =
within 48 hours.=0D<br>*Keep frozen (-10 to -20=B0C) if processed after 48 =
hours or within 7<br>days.=0D<br>*Keep frozen (-70=B0C or less) if processe=
d more than 1 week after<br>collection. The sample is adequately preserved =
at -70=B0C for extended<br>periods of time.=0D<br>- Tissue samples: freeze =

Equine Encephalitis (WEE) virus infection.=0D<br>=0D<br>Human case surveill=
ance=0D<br>-----------------------=0D<br>In areas at risk or with active ou=
tbreaks, it is recommended to<br>implement or strengthen surveillance throu=
gh the search for compatible<br>neurological syndromes that do not have ano=
ther defined diagnosis,<br>taking into account the incubation period, geogr=
aphical area and<br>environmental conditions.=0D<br>=0D<br>Patient manageme=
nt and infection prevention measures in health<br>facilities=0D<br>--------=
-----------------------------------------------------------------=0D<br>The=
re is no specific antiviral treatment. Most infections are<br>characterized=
 by a mild clinical presentation in which treatment is<br>symptomatic. Pati=
ents presenting with neurologic symptoms should be<br>evaluated by a specia=
list and require close monitoring.=0D<br>=0D<br>Prevention measures=0D<br>-=
------------------=0D<br>The preventive actions listed below must be organi=
zed within the<br>framework of One Health, considering the inter-institutio=
nal and<br>comprehensive action between animal health, human health, and th=
e<br>environment.=0D<br>=0D<br>Managing the environment=0D<br>-------------=
-----------=0D<br>Considering the ecology and biology of the main vectors o=
f the WEE<br>virus, the main prevention measure is the modification of the<=
br>environment and the environmental management of the environment,<br>seek=
ing to reduce the number of mosquitoes and their contact with<br>equids and=
 humans. These measures include:=0D<br>- Filling or draining water collecti=
ons, ponds, or temporary flooding<br>sites that may serve as sites of femal=
e oviposition and breeding sites<br>for mosquito larvae.=0D<br>- Eliminatio=
n of weeds around the premises to reduce mosquito resting<br>and shelter si=
tes.=0D<br>- The equids can be protected by sheltering them in barns with<b=
r>mosquito nets, especially at times when mosquitoes are most active.=0D<br=
>- Avoid gatherings and movements of horses at fairs, sporting events,<br>a=
nd similar activities.=0D<br>- Despite the fact that the main vectors do no=
t have indoor habits, it<br>is advisable to protect homes with mosquito net=
s on doors and windows;<br>in this way other arboviruses are also prevented=
.=0D<br>=0D<br>Vector control=0D<br>--------------=0D<br>Vector control mea=
sures for WEE should be considered within the<br>framework of Integrated Ve=
ctor Management (IVM). It is important to<br>consider that the decision to =
carry out vector control activities with<br>insecticides depends on entomol=
ogical surveillance data and the<br>variables that may condition an increas=
e in the risk of transmission,<br>including insecticide resistance data.=0D=
<br>- Insecticide spraying may be considered as an additional measure and,<=
br>where technically feasible, in areas of transmission where high<br>mosqu=
ito populations are detected. The methodology should be<br>established base=
d on the ecology and behavior of the local vectors.=0D<br>=0D<br>Vaccinatio=
n for equids=0D<br>----------------------=0D<br>Vaccines are available for =
equids. It is advisable to seek high<br>vaccination coverage in susceptible=
 equids in areas considered at risk<br>and to carry out annual vaccination =
boosters in these equines.=0D<br>=0D<br>Personal protective measures=0D<br>=
----------------------------=0D<br>- Use of clothing that covers the legs a=
nd arms, especially in homes<br>where someone is sick.=0D<br>- Use of repel=
lents containing DEET, IR3535 or Icaridin, which may be<br>applied to expos=
ed skin or clothing; their use must be in strict<br>accordance with the ins=
tructions on the product label.=0D<br>- Use wire mesh/mosquito netting on d=
oors and windows.=0D<br>- Use of insecticide-treated or non-insecticide net=
s for daytime<br>sleepers (e.g., pregnant women, infants, bedridden, elderl=
y, and night<br>shift workers).=0D<br>- During outbreaks, outdoor activitie=
s should be avoided during the<br>mosquitoes' peak feeding period (dawn and=
 dusk).=0D<br>=0D<br>References=0D<br>----------=0D<br>1. Pan American Heal=
