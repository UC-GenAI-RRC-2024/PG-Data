[1] Selected countries/regions
[A] India: Mumbai records 1st COVID-19 death this year
Date: Mon 8 Jan 2024
Source: The Indian Express [edited]

i-this-year-9098316/>


Mumbai reported its 1st COVID-19 fatality of the year [2024] with a
52-year-old man, who had tested positive for the virus, succumbing on
5 Jan 2024. The previous COVID-19 death was recorded on 9 Aug 2023.

The deceased, a resident of M West ward, was admitted to a government
hospital on 4 Jan 2024, with symptoms such as fever, cough and
breathlessness for 5 days. The patient had tested positive for COVID
and, within 24 hours of admission, passed away, with the cause of
death attributed to respiratory tract infection (LRTI) with sepsis and
septic shock, according to an official from the civic health
department.

Meanwhile, the state reported 154 new COVID cases, with 21 cases in
Mumbai, in the last 24 hours. Another COVID death was recorded in
Nagpur.

The state recorded a recovery rate of 98.17%, a positivity rate of
1.11% and a case fatality rate of 1.81%. Maharashtra has 139 patients
infected with the JN.1 variant.

On the JN.1 variant, Dr Rajesh Karyakarte, head of the BJ Medical
College Microbiology Department and a member of the state COVID-19
task force, said, "While cases are increasing, hospitalisations and
deaths remain low. However, the variant is highly transmissible, and
the recent New Year celebrations without adhering to COVID-appropriate
behaviour have contributed to increased transmission and cases," he
said.

[Although rare, severe complications arising from SARS-CoV-2
infections can still arise. As time passes between individual exposure
to SARS-CoV-2 antigens through infection or vaccination, individual
immunity against SARS-CoV-2 can wane and newer variants may also gain
mutations that may increase their transmissibility, pathogenicity, and
ability to escape individual and population immunity (see item 3 in
this update). It is therefore important for individuals to be aware of
public health risks from respiratory viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 in
surrounding locations and take necessary precautions to reduce risk of
getting infected and passing on infections to others, where possible.

[B] Hong Kong: Double warning over COVID, flu
Date: Fri 5 Jan 2024=20
Source: The Standard [edited]
<https://www.thestandard.com.hk/section-news/section/11/259288/Double-warni=
ng-over-Covid-flu>


Hong Kong is expected to enter the flu peak season next week even as
COVID spreads through a new subvariant -- JN.1 -- which is forecast to
become the dominant strain.

Chuang Shuk-kwan, head of the Centre for Health Protection's
Communicable Disease Branch, said the flu rate had reached a high of
8.49% lately.

But it is difficult to predict how long the peak will last as the
lifting of the mask mandate and Hongkongers' frequent overseas travel
may affect the duration and severity of the season.

"The usual duration of the season in the past was 8 weeks to 12
weeks," she said.

"So it's difficult to predict the exact duration of the season and the
severity."

She urged people to get vaccinated against the flu as soon as possible
and to wear masks in crowded places and on public transport.

"Those who are not feeling well or those who have contacts with sick
people or have respiratory diseases should wear masks," Chuang
stressed.

"People should also wear masks when visiting high-risk places,
including elderly homes and hospitals, as well as crowded indoor
places with poor ventilation."

She said Hong Kong is seeing an active spread of COVID, as viral loads
collected in sewage samples and the number of COVID patients have been
on the rise.

Around 60% of COVID patients in Hong Kong have contracted the JN.1
omicron variant, which has been spreading quickly around the world.

And as the proportion of Hong Kong patients carrying the JN.1 strain
is increasing Chuang expects it will replace XBB to become the new
dominant strain in Hong Kong.

"The proportion of cases with the JN.1 strain around the world has
increased from 3% in early November [2023] to 27% now, and more
patients are contracting the subvariant," she said.

"Fortunately, there is no evidence suggesting the JN.1 strain can lead
to more serious illness compared to other variants, and it is unlikely
to cause a serious public health crisis. The existing vaccine
targeting the XBB variant is also effective against the JN.1 strain."

The head of the CHP's Emergency Response and Program Management
Branch, Albert Au Ka-wing, said the administration has procured 200
000 doses of vaccine targeting the XBB variant and administered around
20 000 jabs for people aged 65 and above and care home residents as of
Wednesday [3 Jan 2024].

He said authorities are planning to expand the vaccination program,
and for people aged 50 to 64, patients with chronic diseases or
impaired immunity, pregnant women and medics to receive the new
vaccine.

Au said most Hongkongers have been fully vaccinated by getting 3 jabs.
But only 30% of children aged 6 months to 3 years old are fully
vaccinated and one-fourth of the elderly aged 80 or above have
received 4 jabs. So he urged them to get booster shots as soon as
possible.

The number of serious illnesses and deaths following COVID infections
remains stable, but Hong Kong has seen 2 children in serious condition
after they contracted the coronavirus.

Hospital Authority senior executive Larry Lee Lap-yip said one case
involved a 4-year-old boy going to Australia during the incubation
period then testing positive for COVID after returning on New Year's
Day.

The boy had a fever and difficulties breathing before being diagnosed
with pneumonia at Tuen Mun Hospital. He had been in serious condition
but became stable after treatment.

A 20-month-old boy with no travel history started developing a fever
last Friday [29 Dec 2023] and tested COVID positive. He was sent to
Prince of Wales Hospital and was found to suffer from croup -- a type
of respiratory infection that commonly occurs in children aged 6
months to 5 years. He is in stable condition.

Lee said the emergency rooms at public hospitals have been receiving
increasing numbers of patients since late last month [December 2023],
with occupancy rates of medical wards surpassing 115%.

The authority has increased manpower and hospital beds and deployed
geriatric doctors to take care of senior patients in emergency rooms,
he said.

[C] Spain: Spanish holiday regions reintroduce COVID-mask rules after
seeing surge in cases
Date: Fri 5 Jan 2024
Source: The Daily Mail (Online) [edited]
<https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12929711/Spanish-holiday-region-r=
eintroduces-Covid-mask-rules-seeing-surge-cases.html>


The COVID and flu epidemic in Spain is becoming so bad that a number
of holiday regions are reintroducing the obligatory mask-wearing rule
in certain cases.

Health authorities across the country are reporting saturated
hospitals and health centres, with patients once again lying in
corridors or waiting hours for treatment.

Family doctors are also calling for the mandatory use of masks in
health centres and hospitals across the whole of Spain, saying the
winter surge of COVID and flu is getting out of control.

The Spanish government hasn't made any announcement about the return
of obligatory mask wearing but regions such as Valencia -- where
tourist hotspots Benidorm and Alicante are located -- are already
imposing their own rules again.

Valencia's health department has today [5 Jan 2024] implemented the
mandatory use of masks in health centres due to the rise in
respiratory infections.

This preventive measure is considered relevant given the incidence in
the Valencian community, with a rate of 1501 cases per 100 000
inhabitants.

The objective is to stop infections and protect vulnerable people.

The department is also relaying the message that health centres will
vaccinate against flu and COVID-19 starting next Monday [8 Jan 2024]
without the need for an appointment.

From today [5 Jan 2024], it will be mandatory to wear a mask when
entering health centres and hospitals throughout the Valencian
community.

The Ministry of Health established the mask protocol due to the spike
in flu cases and respiratory infections in recent weeks.

The last weekly report for influenza, COVID-19 and other respiratory
viruses in 2023 marked a global rate of acute respiratory infection in
primary care of 908.6 cases per 100 000 inhabitants, when the previous
week the figure was 806; and in general at all levels of care of 1501
cases per 100 000 inhabitants

The Department of Health has sent the health departments of 3
provinces an instruction from the General Directorate of Public Health
that establishes the mandatory use of masks in health and social
health centres as a preventive measure in the face of the resurgence
of respiratory virus infection.

Valencia says its health services are at the point of collapse due to
the surge in COVID and flu cases after Christmas and is having to send
patients to provide hospitals in order to cope.

The wave is expected to peak in the 3rd week of January [2024].

There are hospitals in the Valencia province at 96% occupancy and
family doctors are seeing 15 off-schedule patients a day due to these
infections, with influenza A in 7 out of 10 cases.

The Spanish Society for Family Doctors is calling for obligatory mask
wearing in hospitals and medical centres across Spain to stop the
spread of flu and COVID.

Infectious Diseases. 2024 Jan 3:S1473-3099(23)00813-7.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------=
-----
The SARS-CoV-2 BA.2.86 lineage, 1st identified in August 2023, is
phylogenetically distinct from the current circulating SARS-CoV-2
omicron XBB lineages, including EG.5.1 and HK.3. Compared with XBB and
BA.2, BA.2.86 carries more than 30 mutations in the spike protein,
indicating a high potential for immune evasion. BA.2.86 has evolved
and its descendant, JN.1 (BA.2.86.1.1), emerged in late 2023. JN.1
harbours Leu455Ser and 3 mutations in non-spike proteins. Spike
protein mutation Leu455Ser is a hallmark mutation of JN.1: we have
recently shown that HK.3 and other flip variants carry Leu455Phe,
which contributes to increased transmissibility and immune escape
ability compared with the parental EG.5.1 variant. Here, we
investigated the virological properties of JN.1. We estimated the
relative effective reproductive number of JN.1 using genomic
surveillance data from France, the UK, and Spain, where more than 25
sequences of JN.1 have been reported, using a Bayesian multinomial
logistic model. The reproductive number of JN.1 in these 3 countries
was higher than that of BA.2.86.1 and HK.3, one of the XBB lineages
with the highest growth advantage at the end of November 2023. These
results suggest that JN.1 might soon become the dominant lineage
worldwide. Indeed, by the end of November 2023, JN.1 had already
overtaken HK.3 in France and Spain.

The in vitro ACE2 binding assay showed that the dissociation constant
value of the JN.1 receptor-binding domain (RBD) was significantly
higher than that of the BA.2.86 RBD, suggesting that Leu455Ser
decreases binding affinity to the human ACE2 receptor. In contrast,
the pseudovirus assay showed that the infectivity of JN.1 was
significantly higher than that of BA.2.86. This discrepancy could be
due to the difference between monomeric RBD and trimerised whole spike
protein. We then performed a neutralisation assay using rodent sera
infected with BA.2.86 or immunised with BA.2.86 spike protein. In both
cases, the 50% neutralisation titre (NT50) against JN.1 was similar to
that against BA.2.86, suggesting that Leu455Ser does not affect the
antigenicity of BA.2.86. On the other hand, the NT50 of breakthrough
infection sera with XBB.1.5 and EG.5.1 against JN.1 was significantly
lower than that of HK.3 (2=B76-fold to 3=B71-fold) and BA.2.86
(3=B78-fold). Furthermore, JN.1 shows robust resistance to monovalent
XBB.1.5 vaccine sera compared with BA.2.86. Taken together, these
results suggest that JN.1 is one of the most immune-evading variants
to date. Our results suggest that Leu455Ser contributes to increased
immune evasion, which partly explains the increased reproductive
number of JN.1.

[3] New, highly mutated COVID variants 'pirola' BA.2.86 and JN.1 may
cause more severe disease, new studies suggest
Date: Tue 9 Jan 2024
Source: Fortune Well [edited]
<https://fortune.com/well/2024/01/08/covid-omicron-variants-pirola-ba286-jn=
1-more-severe-disease-lung-gi-tract-symptoms/>


Highly mutated COVID variant BA.2.86 -- close ancestor of globally
dominant "pirola" JN.1 -- may lead to more severe disease than other
omicron variants, according to 2 new studies published Monday in the
journal Cell.

In one study, researchers from Ohio State University performed a
variety of experiments using a BA.2.86 pseudovirus -- a lab-created
version that isn't infectious. They found that BA.2.86 can fuse to
human cells more efficiently and infect cells that line the lower
lung--traits that may make it more similar to initial, pre-omicron
strains that were more deadly. [See full article here:
<https://www.cell.com/action/showPdf?pii=3DS0092-8674%2823%2901400-9> -
Mod.LWW]

In the other study, researchers in Germany and France came to the same
conclusion. "BA.2.86 has regained a trait characteristic of early
SARS-CoV-2 lineages: robust lung cell entry," the authors wrote. The
variant "might constitute an elevated health threat as compared to
previous omicron sublineages," they added. [See full article here:
<https://www.cell.com/action/showPdf?pii=3DS0092-8674%2823%2901399-5> -
Mod.LWW]

While illness caused by the initial omicron strain was typically
considered milder than that caused by earlier variants, it's
impossible to say definitively, experts say. That's because those
sickened by omicron had generally already been infected with an
earlier version of the virus, likely softening the blow. Additionally,
many had been vaccinated, to the same effect.

Still, omicron had a penchant for infecting the upper airway versus
the lower airway, where prior versions of the virus tended to
accumulate, causing more severe disease. The new studies offer proof
that this trend may very well be reversing, the authors contend. If
true, it's bad news for those who hoped the virus was slowly
attenuating to the equivalent of a common cold.

"We cannot ignore the evidence" that omicron may be evolving into a
more severe form of itself, Dr. Shan-Lu Liu--professor and co-director
of the Viruses and Emerging Pathogens Program at Ohio State
University, and lead author on the 1st study -- told Fortune.

Increasing COVID hospitalizations in the U.S. and around the globe
potentially bolster the argument, he added.

It's tough to tell if disease caused by COVID is again becoming more
severe because waning immunity muddles matters, experts say. Antibody
immunity to COVID from vaccination or prior infection -- which can
reduce the severity of the disease or prevent infection altogether --
declines after 3 to 6 months. Globally, uptake of the latest COVID
booster, released this past fall [2023], leaves much to be desired. In
the U.S., it sits under 20%, according to the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention. In theory, the longer it's been since someone
was infected with COVID or received a booster, the greater their risk
for severe outcomes like hospitalization and death.

As for what the studies might mean regarding the severity of JN.1
infection, the jury is still out. But the new findings -- combined
with expert speculation that JN.1 may be showing a preference for
infecting the GI tract -- warrant more study into the evolving nature
of the virus, according to Liu.

Another concern of his: the possibility of COVID recombining with
another coronavirus in animals, then transitioning back over to humans
-- throwing another viral plot twist into the pandemic's narrative.

Some experts contend that omicron -- highly mutated compared to
previous strains -- originated in animals, then spilled back over into
humans (as opposed to developing in a human with a long-term
infection, as others contend). Regardless, animals serve as an
underappreciated wild card, Liu contends. Case in point: Many of
Ohio's white-tailed deer have tested positive for COVID, affording the
virus an additional population in which to mutate.

Another, perhaps larger concern of Liu: the possibility that COVID
recombines with another, more deadly coronavirus like SARS or MERS,
which had case fatality rates around 10% and 34%, respectively. In
contrast, COVID's case fatality rate, among unvaccinated Americans,
sat around 1% prior to omicron, and around 0.11% after.

"Anything can happen," Liu said. "It's really hard to predict what's
going to come next, but nature can do amazing things."

The bottom line when it comes to the power of animals to further
evolve the virus and send another curveball flying humanity's way:
"Humans, watch out."

[4] Chile: First detection of omicron variant BA.4.1 lineage in dogs

Medina RA, Neira V. First detection of omicron variant BA.4.1 lineage
in dogs, Chile. The Veterinary Quarterly. 2024 Dec;44(1):1-10.=20
---------------------------------------------------------------------------=
-----
Abstract
--------
SARS-CoV-2's rapid global spread caused the declaration of COVID-19 as
a pandemic in March 2020. Alongside humans, domestic dogs and cats are
also susceptible to infection. However, limited reports on pet
infections in Chile prompted a comprehensive study to address this
knowledge gap. Between March 2021 and March 2023, the study assessed
65 pets (26 dogs and 39 cats) from 33 COVID-19+ households alongside
700 nasal swabs from animals in households with unknown COVID-19
status. RT-PCR, nasal, fecal, and environmental samples were analyzed
for the virus. In COVID-19+ households, 6.06% tested positive for
SARS-CoV-2, belonging to 3 dogs, indicating human-to-pet transmission.
Pets from households with unknown COVID-19 status tested negative for
the virus. We obtained 2 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from animals, that
belonged to omicron BA.4.1 variant, marking the 1st report of pets
infected with this lineage globally. Phylogenetic analysis showed
these sequences clustered with human sequences collected in Chile
during the same period when the BA.4.1 variant was prevalent in the
country. The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in Chilean pets was relatively
low, likely due to the country's high human vaccination rate. Our
study highlights the importance of upholding and strengthening human
vaccination strategies to mitigate the risk of interspecies
transmission. It underscores the critical role of the One Health
approach in addressing emerging zoonotic diseases, calling for further
research on infection dynamics and risk factors for a comprehensive
understanding.

2024. The previous COVID-19 death was recorded on 9 Aug 2023.=0D<br>=0D<br>=
The deceased, a resident of M West ward, was admitted to a government<br>ho=

ing-over-Covid-flu</a>=0D<br>=0D<br>=0D<br>Hong Kong is expected to enter t=
he flu peak season next week even as<br>COVID spreads through a new subvari=
ant -- JN.1 -- which is forecast to<br>become the dominant strain.=0D<br>=0D=
<br>Chuang Shuk-kwan, head of the Centre for Health Protection's<br>Communi=
cable Disease Branch, said the flu rate had reached a high of<br>8.49% late=
ly.=0D<br>=0D<br>But it is difficult to predict how long the peak will last=
 as the<br>lifting of the mask mandate and Hongkongers' frequent overseas t=
ravel<br>may affect the duration and severity of the season.=0D<br>=0D<br>"=
The usual duration of the season in the past was 8 weeks to 12<br>weeks," s=
he said.=0D<br>=0D<br>"So it's difficult to predict the exact duration of t=
he season and the<br>severity."=0D<br>=0D<br>She urged people to get vaccin=
ated against the flu as soon as possible<br>and to wear masks in crowded pl=
aces and on public transport.=0D<br>=0D<br>"Those who are not feeling well =
or those who have contacts with sick<br>people or have respiratory diseases=
 should wear masks," Chuang<br>stressed.=0D<br>=0D<br>"People should also w=
ear masks when visiting high-risk places,<br>including elderly homes and ho=
spitals, as well as crowded indoor<br>places with poor ventilation."=0D<br>=0D=
<br>She said Hong Kong is seeing an active spread of COVID, as viral loads<=
br>collected in sewage samples and the number of COVID patients have been<b=
r>on the rise.=0D<br>=0D<br>Around 60% of COVID patients in Hong Kong have =
contracted the JN.1<br>omicron variant, which has been spreading quickly ar=
ound the world.=0D<br>=0D<br>And as the proportion of Hong Kong patients ca=
rrying the JN.1 strain<br>is increasing Chuang expects it will replace XBB =
to become the new<br>dominant strain in Hong Kong.=0D<br>=0D<br>"The propor=
tion of cases with the JN.1 strain around the world has<br>increased from 3=
% in early November [2023] to 27% now, and more<br>patients are contracting=
 the subvariant," she said.=0D<br>=0D<br>"Fortunately, there is no evidence=
 suggesting the JN.1 strain can lead<br>to more serious illness compared to=
 other variants, and it is unlikely<br>to cause a serious public health cri=
sis. The existing vaccine<br>targeting the XBB variant is also effective ag=
ainst the JN.1 strain."=0D<br>=0D<br>The head of the CHP's Emergency Respon=
se and Program Management<br>Branch, Albert Au Ka-wing, said the administra=
tion has procured 200<br>000 doses of vaccine targeting the XBB variant and=
 administered around<br>20 000 jabs for people aged 65 and above and care h=
ome residents as of<br>Wednesday [3 Jan 2024].=0D<br>=0D<br>He said authori=
ties are planning to expand the vaccination program,<br>and for people aged=
 50 to 64, patients with chronic diseases or<br>impaired immunity, pregnant=
 women and medics to receive the new<br>vaccine.=0D<br>=0D<br>Au said most =
Hongkongers have been fully vaccinated by getting 3 jabs.<br>But only 30% o=
f children aged 6 months to 3 years old are fully<br>vaccinated and one-fou=
rth of the elderly aged 80 or above have<br>received 4 jabs. So he urged th=
em to get booster shots as soon as<br>possible.=0D<br>=0D<br>The number of =
serious illnesses and deaths following COVID infections<br>remains stable, =
but Hong Kong has seen 2 children in serious condition<br>after they contra=
cted the coronavirus.=0D<br>=0D<br>Hospital Authority senior executive Larr=
y Lee Lap-yip said one case<br>involved a 4-year-old boy going to Australia=
 during the incubation<br>period then testing positive for COVID after retu=
rning on New Year's<br>Day.=0D<br>=0D<br>The boy had a fever and difficulti=

--------------------------=0D<br>The SARS-CoV-2 BA.2.86 lineage, 1st identi=
fied in August 2023, is<br>phylogenetically distinct from the current circu=
lating SARS-CoV-2<br>omicron XBB lineages, including EG.5.1 and HK.3. Compa=
red with XBB and<br>BA.2, BA.2.86 carries more than 30 mutations in the spi=
ke protein,<br>indicating a high potential for immune evasion. BA.2.86 has =
evolved<br>and its descendant, JN.1 (BA.2.86.1.1), emerged in late 2023. JN=
.1<br>harbours Leu455Ser and 3 mutations in non-spike proteins. Spike<br>pr=
otein mutation Leu455Ser is a hallmark mutation of JN.1: we have<br>recentl=
y shown that HK.3 and other flip variants carry Leu455Phe,<br>which contrib=
utes to increased transmissibility and immune escape<br>ability compared wi=
th the parental EG.5.1 variant. Here, we<br>investigated the virological pr=
operties of JN.1. We estimated the<br>relative effective reproductive numbe=
r of JN.1 using genomic<br>surveillance data from France, the UK, and Spain=
, where more than 25<br>sequences of JN.1 have been reported, using a Bayes=
ian multinomial<br>logistic model. The reproductive number of JN.1 in these=
 3 countries<br>was higher than that of BA.2.86.1 and HK.3, one of the XBB =
lineages<br>with the highest growth advantage at the end of November 2023. =
These<br>results suggest that JN.1 might soon become the dominant lineage<b=
r>worldwide. Indeed, by the end of November 2023, JN.1 had already<br>overt=
aken HK.3 in France and Spain.=0D<br>=0D<br>The in vitro ACE2 binding assay=
 showed that the dissociation constant<br>value of the JN.1 receptor-bindin=
g domain (RBD) was significantly<br>higher than that of the BA.2.86 RBD, su=
ggesting that Leu455Ser<br>decreases binding affinity to the human ACE2 rec=
eptor. In contrast,<br>the pseudovirus assay showed that the infectivity of=
 JN.1 was<br>significantly higher than that of BA.2.86. This discrepancy co=
uld be<br>due to the difference between monomeric RBD and trimerised whole =
spike<br>protein. We then performed a neutralisation assay using rodent ser=
a<br>infected with BA.2.86 or immunised with BA.2.86 spike protein. In both=
<br>cases, the 50% neutralisation titre (NT50) against JN.1 was similar to<=
br>that against BA.2.86, suggesting that Leu455Ser does not affect the<br>a=
ntigenicity of BA.2.86. On the other hand, the NT50 of breakthrough<br>infe=
ction sera with XBB.1.5 and EG.5.1 against JN.1 was significantly<br>lower =
than that of HK.3 (2=B76-fold to 3=B71-fold) and BA.2.86<br>(3=B78-fold). F=
urthermore, JN.1 shows robust resistance to monovalent<br>XBB.1.5 vaccine s=
era compared with BA.2.86. Taken together, these<br>results suggest that JN=
.1 is one of the most immune-evading variants<br>to date. Our results sugge=
st that Leu455Ser contributes to increased<br>immune evasion, which partly =
explains the increased reproductive<br>number of JN.1.=0D<br>=0D<br>--=0D<b=

initial omicron strain was typically<br>considered milder than that caused =
by earlier variants, it's<br>impossible to say definitively, experts say. T=
hat's because those<br>sickened by omicron had generally already been infec=
ted with an<br>earlier version of the virus, likely softening the blow. Add=
itionally,<br>many had been vaccinated, to the same effect.=0D<br>=0D<br>St=
ill, omicron had a penchant for infecting the upper airway versus<br>the lo=
wer airway, where prior versions of the virus tended to<br>accumulate, caus=
ing more severe disease. The new studies offer proof<br>that this trend may=
 very well be reversing, the authors contend. If<br>true, it's bad news for=
 those who hoped the virus was slowly<br>attenuating to the equivalent of a=
 common cold.=0D<br>=0D<br>"We cannot ignore the evidence" that omicron may=
 be evolving into a<br>more severe form of itself, Dr. Shan-Lu Liu--profess=
or and co-director<br>of the Viruses and Emerging Pathogens Program at Ohio=
 State<br>University, and lead author on the 1st study -- told Fortune.=0D<=
br>=0D<br>Increasing COVID hospitalizations in the U.S. and around the glob=
e<br>potentially bolster the argument, he added.=0D<br>=0D<br>It's tough to=
 tell if disease caused by COVID is again becoming more<br>severe because w=
aning immunity muddles matters, experts say. Antibody<br>immunity to COVID =
from vaccination or prior infection -- which can<br>reduce the severity of =
the disease or prevent infection altogether --<br>declines after 3 to 6 mon=
ths. Globally, uptake of the latest COVID<br>booster, released this past fa=
ll [2023], leaves much to be desired. In<br>the U.S., it sits under 20%, ac=
cording to the Centers for Disease<br>Control and Prevention. In theory, th=
e longer it's been since someone<br>was infected with COVID or received a b=
ooster, the greater their risk<br>for severe outcomes like hospitalization =
and death.=0D<br>=0D<br>As for what the studies might mean regarding the se=
verity of JN.1<br>infection, the jury is still out. But the new findings --=
 combined<br>with expert speculation that JN.1 may be showing a preference =
for<br>infecting the GI tract -- warrant more study into the evolving natur=
e<br>of the virus, according to Liu.=0D<br>=0D<br>Another concern of his: t=
he possibility of COVID recombining with<br>another coronavirus in animals,=
 then transitioning back over to humans<br>-- throwing another viral plot t=
wist into the pandemic's narrative.=0D<br>=0D<br>Some experts contend that =
omicron -- highly mutated compared to<br>previous strains -- originated in =
animals, then spilled back over into<br>humans (as opposed to developing in=
 a human with a long-term<br>infection, as others contend). Regardless, ani=
mals serve as an<br>underappreciated wild card, Liu contends. Case in point=
: Many of<br>Ohio's white-tailed deer have tested positive for COVID, affor=
ding the<br>virus an additional population in which to mutate.=0D<br>=0D<br=
>Another, perhaps larger concern of Liu: the possibility that COVID<br>reco=
mbines with another, more deadly coronavirus like SARS or MERS,<br>which ha=
d case fatality rates around 10% and 34%, respectively. In<br>contrast, COV=
ID's case fatality rate, among unvaccinated Americans,<br>sat around 1% pri=
or to omicron, and around 0.11% after.=0D<br>=0D<br>"Anything can happen," =
Liu said. "It's really hard to predict what's<br>going to come next, but na=
ture can do amazing things."=0D<br>=0D<br>The bottom line when it comes to =
the power of animals to further<br>evolve the virus and send another curveb=

ract=0D<br>--------=0D<br>SARS-CoV-2's rapid global spread caused the decla=
ration of COVID-19 as<br>a pandemic in March 2020. Alongside humans, domest=
ic dogs and cats are<br>also susceptible to infection. However, limited rep=
orts on pet<br>infections in Chile prompted a comprehensive study to addres=
s this<br>knowledge gap. Between March 2021 and March 2023, the study asses=
sed<br>65 pets (26 dogs and 39 cats) from 33 COVID-19+ households alongside=
<br>700 nasal swabs from animals in households with unknown COVID-19<br>sta=
tus. RT-PCR, nasal, fecal, and environmental samples were analyzed<br>for t=
he virus. In COVID-19+ households, 6.06% tested positive for<br>SARS-CoV-2,=
 belonging to 3 dogs, indicating human-to-pet transmission.<br>Pets from ho=
useholds with unknown COVID-19 status tested negative for<br>the virus. We =
obtained 2 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from animals, that<br>belonged to omicron BA.=
4.1 variant, marking the 1st report of pets<br>infected with this lineage g=
lobally. Phylogenetic analysis showed<br>these sequences clustered with hum=
an sequences collected in Chile<br>during the same period when the BA.4.1 v=
ariant was prevalent in the<br>country. The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in Chi=
lean pets was relatively<br>low, likely due to the country's high human vac=
cination rate. Our<br>study highlights the importance of upholding and stre=
ngthening human<br>vaccination strategies to mitigate the risk of interspec=
ies<br>transmission. It underscores the critical role of the One Health<br>=
approach in addressing emerging zoonotic diseases, calling for further<br>r=
esearch on infection dynamics and risk factors for a comprehensive<br>under=
