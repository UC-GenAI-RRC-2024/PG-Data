A recently identified species of mosquito, colloquially known as
"Steve" (scientifically _Anopheles stephensi_), is causing a surge in
malaria infections across Africa, prompting growing public health
concerns, as reported by the World Health Organisation (WHO).=20

Originating in South Asia, the "Steve" mosquito was first identified
in Djibouti in 2012.=20

Why it matters
--------------
- Since its initial detection, the country has experienced a
staggering increase in malaria rates.=20
- Subsequently, the mosquito has spread to 7 African countries,
including Ethiopia, Sudan, Somalia, Kenya, Nigeria, and Ghana.=20
- Distinguishing itself from other mosquitoes that typically breed in
rivers and swamps, the "Steve" mosquito is an urban breeder, thriving
in dry environments.=20
- Its ability to survive with minimal moisture, utilising water
trapped in containers, tyres, and gutters, makes it particularly
challenging to control.=20
- Adding to the concern, this new species exhibits unique behaviours,
such as biting outdoors during daylight hours and displaying immunity
to commonly used pesticides.=20

Dr. Dorothy Achu, WHO's lead for tropical diseases in Africa,
emphasised the threat posed by "Steve" in urban settings, challenging
current strategies primarily focused on indoor interventions.=20

She noted the difficulty in detecting and eliminating this resilient
mosquito from harsh climates, further complicating efforts to curb its
impact on public health.=20

As the "Steve" mosquito continues to spread, health officials are
grappling with the urgent need for innovative strategies to address
this emerging threat to malaria control in Africa.=20

What you should know
--------------------
- According to the World Health Organisation report, the African
region carries a disproportionately large share of the global malaria
burden. In 2022, the region was home to 94% of malaria cases and 95%
of malaria deaths.=20
- Children under the age of 5 accounted for 80% of these deaths.
- Malaria is a life-threatening parasitic disease spread to humans by
some species of mosquitoes.
- Several African nations continue to implement comprehensive malaria
control programs, leveraging a combination of preventative measures,
diagnostic tools, and treatment interventions.
- Some progress towards the fight against malaria has been made in the
African Region. Nairametrics reported that 3 African nations have
received the malaria vaccine.=20
- Nairametrics also reported that 3 African countries have been
declared malaria-free with Cape Verde being the latest.=20

WHO initiative to stop the spread of _Anopheles stephensi_ in Africa
--------------------------------------------------------------------
_Anopheles stephensi_ at a glance
---------------------------------
_Anopheles stephensi_ is a mosquito species that is capable of
transmitting both _Plasmodium falciparum_ and _P. vivax_ malaria
parasites. It was originally native to South Asia and parts of the
Arabian Peninsula but has been expanding its range over the last
decade, with detections reported in Djibouti (2012), Ethiopia and
Sudan (2016), Somalia (2019), Nigeria (2020) and Ghana and Kenya
(2022). To date, it remains unclear when and via which route these
countries were invaded. Although _An. stephensi_ has likely spread to
other African countries, it has yet to be detected as systematic,
large-scale surveillance of the vector is still in its infancy.

Spread of _Anopheles stephensi_ in Africa [map].

_Anopheles stephensi_ has the capacity to thrive in urban and man-made
environments, setting it apart from the other main mosquito vectors of
malaria that primarily breed in naturally occurring waterbodies in
rural areas. Where _An. stephensi_ has been reported in Africa, it has
been found to be resistant to many of the insecticides used in public
health, posing an added challenge to its control.

The invasion of _An. stephensi_ in sub-Saharan Africa -- where the
burden of malaria is highest and over 40% of the population lives in
urban environments -- is particularly worrying. Since 2012, _An.
stephensi_ is thought to have contributed to a resurgence of malaria
in Djibouti City and at least one outbreak of the disease in Ethiopia.
While the overall contribution of _An. stephensi_ to malaria
transmission in the region is unclear, the rapid growth of many
African cities, coupled with the invasion and spread of this highly
efficient and adaptable malaria vector, could undermine the gains made
in reducing the burden of the disease.=20

Number of reported malaria cases in Djibouti, 2010-2021 [graph].

In a 2019 vector alert, the World Health Organization (WHO) identified
the spread of _An. stephensi_ as a significant threat to malaria
control and elimination -- particularly in Africa. An updated vector
alert, published in January 2023, provided new data on the presence of
_An. stephensi_ and additional guidance for national malaria control
programmes.=20

WHO launched an initiative in September 2022 to further raise
awareness of this threat and to catalyze existing work by its Member
States and their implementing partners to stop the spread of _An.
stephensi_ in the African region. A key aim of this undertaking is to
determine whether the vector can be eliminated from areas that have
already been invaded.

As part of this initiative, WHO has been collaborating with National
Malaria Programmes and partners to track the spread of _An.
stephensi_; the latest data are available on the Malaria Threats Map.
Additionally, WHO organized a convening of partners in Ethiopia in
March 2023 and continues to provide support to countries in areas such
as improving mosquito identification.

Modelling the potential impact of _Anopheles stephensi_
-------------------------------------------------------
Recent mathematical modelling studies have attempted to show how and
where _An. stephensi_ might be spreading, and the potential
implications for malaria transmission and control in Africa. One study
projected that _An. stephensi_ could put an additional 126 million
people in Africa at risk of malaria if the mosquito vector were to
spread unchecked. Another study estimated that the number of malaria
cases in Ethiopia could increase by 50% if _An. stephensi_ were to
spread to all receptive areas. However, these models are based on
assumptions that have not been fully validated in the African context,
and any results should be interpreted with caution.

Malaria hits hardest in the African Region
------------------------------------------
In 2021, the vast majority of all malaria cases (95%) and deaths (96%)
were found in the WHO African Region. Young African children bear the
brunt of the disease: nearly 80% of all malaria deaths in the region
are among children under the age of 5. Many African countries with
moderate to high malaria transmission saw a significant reduction in
their malaria burden between 2000 and 2015. However, the rate of
progress has levelled off in recent years, and disruptions to malaria
services during the COVID-19 pandemic further jeopardized malaria
control efforts in the region.

In 2021 the WHO African Region reported 247 million new malaria cases,
619 000 malaria-related deaths.=20

WHO initiative to stop the spread of _Anopheles stephensi_ in Africa:
To support an effective response to _An. stephensi_ on the African
continent, WHO launched an initiative in September 2022 aimed at:

- Increasing collaboration.=20
National malaria control programmes, researchers, funders, and other
actors conducting surveillance, research and control of _An.
stephensi_ must collaborate effectively to ensure that knowledge is
shared, resources are used optimally, and key activities are
prioritized. As _An. Stephensi_ has the potential to spread quickly,
cross-border collaboration is essential, and countries should work
together to ensure an effective regional approach.

- Strengthening surveillance
Entomological surveillance can determine the extent of the spread of
_An. stephensi_ and its role in transmission; it is essential to
target specific control measures and assess their impact. Human
malaria case surveillance should be used to investigate the potential
impact of the vector's presence on malaria, particularly in urban
areas. Such surveillance might provide an indication of the presence
of _An. stephensi_ in areas where it has not yet been detected.

- Improving information exchange
Information on the presence of _An. stephensi_, as well as on
successes and failures in attempts to control the vector, needs to be
documented and shared widely and rapidly -- at both national and
international levels -- to determine best practices and inform the
response across invaded areas.=20

- Developing guidance
National malaria control programmes need evidence-based guidance on
the appropriate ways to conduct surveillance, implement control
measures, develop by-laws, and devote resources to their response to
_An. stephensi_. WHO has provided a preliminary set of recommendations
in its 2023 vector alert. This guidance will be reviewed and, where
appropriate, updated based on best practices and other evidence
identified as part of the regional initiative.

- Prioritizing research
It will be important to evaluate the impact of vector control
interventions, and particularly new tools, against _An. stephensi_.
Conducting research focused on_An. stephensi_ will enable programmes
to find better ways of responding to this invasive vector and of
integrating control efforts with those targeted at other mosquito
vectors.

Strategies against invasive vectors
-----------------------------------
Generally, in responding to invasive species, 3 sequential approaches
can be considered. By systematically evaluating these approaches --
starting with the feasibility, efficacy and impact of control
interventions -- an evidence-based strategy can be built.=20

1. Control
Accepting that the species has invaded certain areas, and controlling
it to mitigate a potential increase in the malaria burden where it is
present.

2. Containment
Allowing the species to remain in a certain area but conducting
surveillance and intensive control, particularly at the fringes, to
prevent further spread.

3. Elimination
Eliminating the species from the invaded area by building on efforts
made under strategies 1 and 2.

While the feasibility of these strategies is not yet known when it
comes to _An. stephensi_ in Africa, it is essential that action be
taken to build an evidence base to assess their validity while
responding to the task at hand of halting the spread of this invasive
vector across Africa.

Building and maintaining an integrated response
-----------------------------------------------
National responses to _An. stephensi_ should be part of a
comprehensive response to malaria vectors, guided by the WHO Global
technical strategy for malaria 2016-2030. Where feasible, integration
with efforts to control other vector-borne diseases should be
explored, as for example in the area of breeding site surveillance in
urban and in peri-urban areas. The WHO Global Vector Control Response
2017-2030 provides a framework for investigating and implementing such
integration across vector-borne diseases.

Tracking the spread of _Anopheles stephensi_
--------------------------------------------
The WHO Malaria Threats Map features a dedicated section on invasive
vectors, including _An. stephensi_. All confirmed reports of the
presence of _An. stephensi_ should be reported to WHO to enable an
open sharing of data and an up-to-date understanding of the vector's
distribution and spread. This knowledge will ultimately provide a
basis to assess the effectiveness of any efforts to control or
eliminate _An. stephensi_.

[Control of malaria in Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant
challenges. Vector mosquitoes are developing insecticide resistance,
the malaria parasite is becoming resistant to one of its main
treatment drugs for falciparum malaria, artemisinin, and since 2012
there has been invasion of an effective malaria vector, _Anopjeles
stephensi_. The breeding and behavioral habits of this vector mosquito
vector, as noted in the WHO report above, are sufficiently different
from the established vectors present in these countries, that changes
in monitoring and control will be necessary. There are no apparent
ecological barriers that would block spread of this mosquito to the
countries neighboring the 7 in which this mosquito has been found.=20

As Mod.LXL noted in a previous post, "one bright spot is the advent of
increasingly effective vaccines against the invasive stage of _P.
falciparum_, starting with the RTS,S malaria vaccine, and more
recently the R21/Matrix-M vaccine, which has demonstrated impressive
efficacy in phase 2b multi-country trials."=20

It will be interesting to learn how the affected countries are dealing
with _Anopheles stephensi_ and if vaccination against falciparum
malaria will be adopted into national immunization programs in both
rural, urban, peri-urban areas of risk. - Mod.TY

rom other mosquitoes that typically breed in<br>rivers and swamps, the "Ste=
ve" mosquito is an urban breeder, thriving<br>in dry environments.=20=0D<br=
>- Its ability to survive with minimal moisture, utilising water<br>trapped=
 in containers, tyres, and gutters, makes it particularly<br>challenging to=
 control.=20=0D<br>- Adding to the concern, this new species exhibits uniqu=
e behaviours,<br>such as biting outdoors during daylight hours and displayi=
ng immunity<br>to commonly used pesticides.=20=0D<br>=0D<br>Dr. Dorothy Ach=
u, WHO's lead for tropical diseases in Africa,<br>emphasised the threat pos=

-----------------------------------------------=0D<br>_Anopheles stephensi_=
 at a glance=0D<br>---------------------------------=0D<br>_Anopheles steph=
ensi_ is a mosquito species that is capable of<br>transmitting both _Plasmo=
dium falciparum_ and _P. vivax_ malaria<br>parasites. It was originally nat=
ive to South Asia and parts of the<br>Arabian Peninsula but has been expand=
ing its range over the last<br>decade, with detections reported in Djibouti=
 (2012), Ethiopia and<br>Sudan (2016), Somalia (2019), Nigeria (2020) and G=
hana and Kenya<br>(2022). To date, it remains unclear when and via which ro=
ute these<br>countries were invaded. Although _An. stephensi_ has likely sp=
read to<br>other African countries, it has yet to be detected as systematic=
,<br>large-scale surveillance of the vector is still in its infancy.=0D<br>=0D=
<br>Spread of _Anopheles stephensi_ in Africa [map].=0D<br>=0D<br>_Anophele=
s stephensi_ has the capacity to thrive in urban and man-made<br>environmen=
ts, setting it apart from the other main mosquito vectors of<br>malaria tha=
t primarily breed in naturally occurring waterbodies in<br>rural areas. Whe=
re _An. stephensi_ has been reported in Africa, it has<br>been found to be =
resistant to many of the insecticides used in public<br>health, posing an a=
dded challenge to its control.=0D<br>=0D<br>The invasion of _An. stephensi_=
 in sub-Saharan Africa -- where the<br>burden of malaria is highest and ove=
r 40% of the population lives in<br>urban environments -- is particularly w=
orrying. Since 2012, _An.<br>stephensi_ is thought to have contributed to a=
 resurgence of malaria<br>in Djibouti City and at least one outbreak of the=
 disease in Ethiopia.<br>While the overall contribution of _An. stephensi_ =
to malaria<br>transmission in the region is unclear, the rapid growth of ma=
ny<br>African cities, coupled with the invasion and spread of this highly<b=
r>efficient and adaptable malaria vector, could undermine the gains made<br=
>in reducing the burden of the disease.=20=0D<br>=0D<br>Number of reported =
malaria cases in Djibouti, 2010-2021 [graph].=0D<br>=0D<br>In a 2019 vector=
 alert, the World Health Organization (WHO) identified<br>the spread of _An=
. stephensi_ as a significant threat to malaria<br>control and elimination =
-- particularly in Africa. An updated vector<br>alert, published in January=
 2023, provided new data on the presence of<br>_An. stephensi_ and addition=
al guidance for national malaria control<br>programmes.=20=0D<br>=0D<br>WHO=
 launched an initiative in September 2022 to further raise<br>awareness of =
this threat and to catalyze existing work by its Member<br>States and their=
 implementing partners to stop the spread of _An.<br>stephensi_ in the Afri=
can region. A key aim of this undertaking is to<br>determine whether the ve=
ctor can be eliminated from areas that have<br>already been invaded.=0D<br>=0D=
<br>As part of this initiative, WHO has been collaborating with National<br=
>Malaria Programmes and partners to track the spread of _An.<br>stephensi_;=
 the latest data are available on the Malaria Threats Map.<br>Additionally,=
 WHO organized a convening of partners in Ethiopia in<br>March 2023 and con=
tinues to provide support to countries in areas such<br>as improving mosqui=
to identification.=0D<br>=0D<br>Modelling the potential impact of _Anophele=
s stephensi_=0D<br>-------------------------------------------------------=0D=
<br>Recent mathematical modelling studies have attempted to show how and<br=
>where _An. stephensi_ might be spreading, and the potential<br>implication=
s for malaria transmission and control in Africa. One study<br>projected th=
at _An. stephensi_ could put an additional 126 million<br>people in Africa =
at risk of malaria if the mosquito vector were to<br>spread unchecked. Anot=
her study estimated that the number of malaria<br>cases in Ethiopia could i=
ncrease by 50% if _An. stephensi_ were to<br>spread to all receptive areas.=
 However, these models are based on<br>assumptions that have not been fully=
 validated in the African context,<br>and any results should be interpreted=
 with caution.=0D<br>=0D<br>Malaria hits hardest in the African Region=0D<b=
r>------------------------------------------=0D<br>In 2021, the vast majori=
ty of all malaria cases (95%) and deaths (96%)<br>were found in the WHO Afr=
ican Region. Young African children bear the<br>brunt of the disease: nearl=
y 80% of all malaria deaths in the region<br>are among children under the a=
ge of 5. Many African countries with<br>moderate to high malaria transmissi=
on saw a significant reduction in<br>their malaria burden between 2000 and =
2015. However, the rate of<br>progress has levelled off in recent years, an=
d disruptions to malaria<br>services during the COVID-19 pandemic further j=
eopardized malaria<br>control efforts in the region.=0D<br>=0D<br>In 2021 t=
