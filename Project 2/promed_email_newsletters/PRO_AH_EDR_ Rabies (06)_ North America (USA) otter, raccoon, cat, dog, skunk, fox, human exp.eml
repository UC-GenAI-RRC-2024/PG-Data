[1] Florida (Beach County): otter, dog, human exposure

A 74-year-old Florida man was attacked and bitten by a rabid otter,
sending the man to the hospital for treatment of multiple wounds on
his hands, arms and legs. [JS], of Jupiter, Florida, was feeding ducks
at a small pond near his home when he turned to leave. He heard the
ducks flush, according to The Miami Herald, and turned to find an
otter walking down the bank toward him.

[JS] backtracked to a fence gate, but before he could get through it
the otter attacked. It bit and scratched his feet and legs, and then
[JS]'s arms and hands as he tried to fend off the crazed animal. It
finally stopped but also attacked a neighbor's dog. [JS] had 41 wounds
requiring treatment, and also received various vaccinations. The dog
was treated by a local veterinarian.

"I started to push it away, and it started to bite my hands," [JS]
told WPTV. "One of the bites is on my pinkie, and it ripped the nail
off the pinkie. [It] looks like the tooth went completely through my
finger."

The otter was trapped under a recycling bin by the Jupiter Police
Department. It then was captured in a cage by Palm Beach Animal Care
and Control, and taken to the Florida Department of Health for rabies
testing.

Coincidentally, the Florida attack happened 7 weeks after 3 women were
attacked by an otter while floating on the Jefferson River in Montana.
The 3 women were in the middle of the river and were unable to stand
because of the depth. They kicked and punched at the otter, which
finally moved away.

Gwinnett officials are warning people of a potential rabies outbreak.
On 4 Jan 2024, a rabid raccoon bit 2 dogs in Snellville, according to
the Gwinnett Animal Shelter.

Officials said rabies can spread to people through a bite or a scratch
[from an unvaccinated animal - Mod.TG]. The shelter encouraged pet
owners to ensure their pets have the current rabies vaccination.

Officials also said if your child [or yourself] has been bitten or
scratched by a stray animal, preventive rabies treatment is
necessary.

Anyone in the area who has been exposed is asked to call the Gwinnett
County Health Department and ask for the epidemiologist on call.

[3] Georgia (Glynn County): raccoon, dog

<https://news.yahoo.com/rabies-alert-sick-raccoon-spotted-215147886.html>


The Glynn County Health Department is alerting residents in Brunswick
about a raccoon having tested positive for rabies.

Several species of wild animals including raccoons, foxes, and bats
can carry rabies. Feral cats and dogs can also carry this disease.
Rabies is a potentially deadly virus primarily spread by infected
animals.

Reports from the Glynn County Health Department state the raccoon was
discovered in a family's shed on Blythe Island Highway yesterday [11
Jan 2024]. There are also reports of an encounter between the raccoon
and the family's dog.

The racoon was quickly captured while the dog was rushed to the vet.
The dog had previously been vaccinated against rabies and received its
booster. The dog's owners did not report having any physical contact
with the raccoon.

Reports state while captured, the racoon passed away.

The Glynn County Environmental Health office prepared a sample from
the infected raccoon and delivered it to the lab on the morning of 12
Jan 2024. A positive rabies test result was reported at 2:00 p.m.

The dog's owners have been contacted with the results, and the dog
will be placed on a 45-day quarantine.

The health department will provide guidance to the owners about
post-exposure rabies treatment, encouraging them to follow the
recommendations of poison control and their personal physician to
determine the level of exposure they had to the racoon.

The Glynn County Environmental Health office wants to use this as an
important reminder to avoid contact with wild animals and to keep your
pets up to date on rabies vaccinations.

Follow these tips to protect you and your family from rabies:
- Avoid contact with animals you don't know.
- Make sure your pets receive the proper immunizations. Dogs and cats
should get rabies vaccines after 12 weeks of age, followed by a
booster shot within 1 year and vaccination every 1-3 years depending
on veterinary recommendation and vaccine used.
- Do not handle, feed, or unintentionally attract wild animals with
open garbage cans or by leaving pet food out at night.
- Never adopt wild animals or bring them into your home. Do not try to
nurse sick animals to health. Call animal control or a properly
licensed animal rescue agency for assistance.
- Teach children to never handle unfamiliar animals, wild or domestic,
even if they appear friendly. "Love your own, leave other animals
alone" is a good principle for children to learn.

Signs of rabies in animals include:
- Change in behavior
- Biting
- Aggression
- Showing no fear of natural enemies (such as humans)
- Foaming at the mouth
- Paralysis

If an animal ever bites you, seek medical care immediately and contact
Glynn County Animal Control and the Glynn County Health Department
Environmental Health office.

[4] Pennsylvania (Adams County): cat, human exposure
Date: Fri 12 Jan 2024
Source: MSN [edited]
<https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/rabies-case-in-adams-county-confirmed-af=
ter-woman-attacked-by-stray-cat/ar-AA1mT3P1>


There was a confirmed case of rabies in Adams County earlier this
week, according to the Adams County SPCA. In a Facebook post on Friday
[12 Jan 2024], the county's SPCA wrote about a woman attacked by a
stray cat when she approached it.

The woman was at an auto garage, along the intersection of Hanover
Street and Rt. 94 in Oxford Township, when she saw a stray cat, out in
the rain on Tuesday [9 Jan 2024]. When she tried to pick up the cat,
it attacked her left hand and arm, the post reads.

The cat was trapped the next day [10 Jan 2024], taken to the SPCA to
be humanely euthanized, and taken to the Pennsylvania Veterinary
Laboratory (PALDS) to be tested for rabies virus. When the test
results came back, it showed the cat had the [rabies] virus, the post
reads.

The human nervous system is attacked by the rabies virus which can be
contracted if an animal bites, scratches, or if their saliva gets in
the eyes, nose, mouth, or an opening in the skin, according to the
SPCA. It, however, can be completely preventable.

If one comes in contact with the virus they should contact their
doctor immediately, the SPCA wrote. [If an animal you have interacted
with is found to be rabies positive, it is important start the rabies
post-exposure prophylaxis treatment immediately. - Mod.TG]

The SPCA offers the following tips on how to stay clear of exposure to
rabies:
- All dogs and cats 3 months or older are required by Pennsylvania law
to be vaccinated by a licensed veterinarian.
- Don't let pets just roam free.
- Do not keep your pet's food or water bowls outdoors because it can
attract other animals.
- Do not touch or handle unfamiliar or wild animals even if they
appear friendly.

Health officials are urging pet owners to vaccinate their animals
against rabies following an attack on 2 dogs by a skunk in Bedford on
Thursday [11 Jan 2024].

The Bedford Police Department said a woman was walking her 2 dogs near
Silverwood Lane when they were approached by a skunk. The skunk
reportedly attacked the dogs and was found dead in the same area a
short time later by Animal Services officers.

According to Bedford Animal Services, skunks are not frequently active
during the day because they are primarily nocturnal animals.

"The skunk will be tested for any diseases, and if there are any
positive results that could be a concern to the community, the City
will provide additional updates when available," Bedford Police said
in a released statement.

The City of Bedford requires all dogs and cats must be vaccinated
against rabies by 4 months of age and then at regular intervals under
rules adopted by the Texas Health and Safety Code.

[6] New York (Oneida County): fox, human exp
Date: Wed 17 Jan 2024 12:50 EST
Source: WIBX 950 [edited]
<https://wibx950.com/potentially-rabid-fox-that-attacked-multiple-people-in=
-rome-is-confirmed-dead/>


The Oneida County Health Department confirmed the fox that attacked 3
people in Rome was rabid. The animal was killed by a private resident
and its remains were sent in for testing at the New York State
Department of Health Wadsworth Center.

Another person has since come forward about being exposed to the fox
and is also undergoing post-exposure prophylaxis. This brings the
total number of individuals exposed to the animal to 4; however,
anyone who encountered the rabid fox is now strongly advised to seek
immediate treatment as rabies is a fatal disease.

Even if no bite took place, residents are still urged to call and make
an appointment.

As previously reported, The Oneida County Health Department and Rome
Police say 3 people were attacked by the rabid fox around the Mohawk
River and Black River Boulevard area over the weekend. The health
department is also urging those who may have had contact with the fox
to contact the OC Health Department and seek post-exposure
prophylaxis, as it can save their life.

Said the health department, "Rabies is a deadly disease, and if you
become exposed, it is vital to get appropriate care to avoid
contracting rabies."

Mount Sinai says those exposed to a rabid animal have at least up to
14 days to receive post-exposure prophylaxis. Rabies is fatal and
while there have been claims of humans surviving the disease,
scientific papers about these cases have been retracted -- thus
casting doubt these claims are actually legitimate.

Additionally, authorities are also urging pet owners to ensure their
pets' rabies vaccine is up to date amid a troubling rise of this
deadly disease in the area.

Rabies on the rise in New York
------------------------------
County officials are strongly urging residents to learn how to
recognize a potentially rabid animal and to teach their children to
never play with unknown animals either wild or domestic.

Madison County Department of Health's Aaron Lazzara warned, "We are
seeing more rabid animals this year than the last 2 years combined."

Additionally, officials urged pet owners to be aware of the growing
number of reports of wild animals infected with rabies and ensure
their pets are protected. [Be sure their rabies vaccine is current and
up to date. If you have questions contact your veterinarian. - Mod.TG]
Recently in Herkimer County, a family dog killed a rabid raccoon.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, wildlife
accounts for over 90% of all reported rabies cases. Skunks, foxes,
raccoons, coyotes, and bats make up the majority of rabies cases in
the United States, but the disease is capable of infecting horses,
ferrets, cattle and other warm-blooded animals.

Rabies is transmitted through direct contact with an infected animal
through its saliva or nervous system tissue. People can get infected
if bitten from a rabid animal. [It is not always a bite, but may be
saliva of a rabid animal in the eye or in a cut. - Mod.TG]

The Oneida County Health Department warned: "If you see an animal,
wild or stray, with these signs, do not approach it and stay away. If
any animal is acting strangely, call your local animal control officer
for help. If you are concerned you may have been exposed to a rabid
animal or find a bat in your home, call Oneida County Health
Department for guidance."

Signs and symptoms of the disease include drooling or foaming from the
mouth, abnormal or aggressive behavior, paralysis, seizures,
difficulty swallowing, and self-mutilation.

The disease is always fatal, which is why officials stress the
importance of vaccinating your pets against rabies. It's also the law.
New York mandates all pet owners vaccinate their dogs, cats, and
ferrets by the time they're 4 months old.

Even if you have an indoor-only pet, vaccinating it will protect your
animal if it ever slips outside and encounters a sick animal. [There
are cases of wild animals running into homes. While this is not usual,
it does happen and such events can put you and your pet at risk of
rabies. - Mod.TG]

Per Herkimer County officials: "Herkimer County Public Health would
like to remind the public to please check your pets' rabies
vaccination records to make sure they are up to date. If they are not
up to date, make an appointment with their vet or Public Health as
soon as possible to have them vaccinated against rabies."

If an unvaccinated pet is bitten by a rabid animal, it will need to be
euthanized immediately as the disease is 100% fatal. There is also no
USDA-licensed treatment or cure for rabies in unvaccinated domestic
animals.

Lazzara noted vaccinating your pets does more than protect them
against the virus. "We never want anyone to have to make a decision to
euthanize an unvaccinated family pet having come in contact with a
rabid animal," he said.

There are several pet rabies clinics scheduled in central NY in the
new year [2024], but dates and locations have yet to be announced.
Appointments are required. And while the clinics are free, the
department requests a $10 donation per pet to assist with costs. To
learn more about these clinics or find one closest to you, contact the
Oneida County Health Department.

[This is not the first time rabies has been reported in otters. They
are wild mammals and all mammals are susceptible to the ravages of the
rabies virus. We don't often hear about them, so this article should
serve as a warning that cute fuzzy little critters who seem more clown
than vicious animal are still susceptible to this horrible disease.

If you take your dog hiking or camping, it is especially important to
keep them up to date on their vaccines. But likewise, even your house
cat or pet dog need to be vaccinated for their protection and yours.
There are reports of wild animals and bats getting into houses and
biting both people and pets.

The best way to protect your pet is to keep it current on its
vaccination. It also is appropriate to be alert on your walks or even
bringing in the groceries. Attacks by rabid animals can happen in a
town or city just as easily as on the trail or in the rural areas.

Most states have regulations in place that mandate animals 4 months or
older must be vaccinate against rabies.

If you are bitten, seek medical help immediately. This is a deadly
disease. Post-exposure prophylaxis is available through a physician or
sometimes your county health department but you will learn where when
seeking out medical help if you are bitten.

Please recall even large animals -- horses, cows, pigs, sheep, and
goats -- are also susceptible to this disease. - Mod.TG
