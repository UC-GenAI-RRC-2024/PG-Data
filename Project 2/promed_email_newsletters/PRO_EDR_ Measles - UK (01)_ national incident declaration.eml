MEASLES - UK (01): NATIONAL INCIDENT DECLARATION

An urgent vaccination drive is needed to ward off a growing wave of
measles outbreaks, health chiefs said last night [18 Jan 2024].

Declaring an official 'national incident', the UK Health Security
Agency warned that too few youngsters were protected against the
potentially deadly virus.

Jenny Harries, the agency's chief executive, urged parents to check
whether their children had had the measles, mumps and rubella jab and
said the UK was on a 'trajectory for everything getting much worse'.=20

It is a far cry from 2016, when Britain was declared measles-free by
the World Health Organisation.

The disease, which causes flu-like symptoms and a nasty rash, proves
fatal in roughly 1 in every 5000 cases.=20

Vaccination rates have fallen across the country with London and the
West Midlands among the worst regions.

The latter has had more than 300 confirmed and probable cases since 1
Oct 2023. Most victims were under 10.=20

The declaration of a national incident signifies a growing public
health risk and enables the agency to focus work in specific
locations.

Dame Jenny told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the vaccination
programme was 'clearly not' at the right level.

The professor added: 'We had established measles elimination status in
the UK, but in fact our vaccination rates now have dropped on average
to about only 85% of children arriving at school having had the 2 MMR
doses.

'In the West Midlands, that's in some areas down to 81%. If we go down
to the Surrey Heartlands integrated care board area, that's just over
70%.

'So we are well under the recommended coverage for MMR vaccination
that the World Health Organisation recommends.=20

'We want it to be 95% coverage. We need a call to action right across
the country.

'Colleagues across the West Midlands have worked tirelessly to try to
control the outbreak, but with vaccine uptake in some communities so
low, there is now a very real risk of seeing the virus spread in other
towns and cities.'

Last year [2023] 84.5% of youngsters in England had received both MMR
doses by the time they were 5 - the lowest rate since 2010/11 - and
92.5% had received at least one dose.

Experts attribute the fall in uptake to anti-vax sentiment, pandemic
disruption and a discredited 1998 study suggesting a link between the
MMR jab and autism.

Dame Jenny said some Muslim communities had shunned the MMR vaccine
because it contains ingredients derived from pork -- but she stressed
vegan versions were available.

She added: 'It's quite common with vaccination programmes that when
the risk is perceived to have gone away, then the concern to get
vaccinated may drop off and so one of the reasons for flagging this is
to remind people that cases are still out there. This is a serious
illness.'

The dire consequences of measles were last night [18 Jan 2024]
highlighted by [GLJ], whose 6-year-old son [SLJ] died from a brain
inflammation caused by measles in 2019.

Sharing her story to encourage parents to vaccinate more, she said: 'I
honestly do believe that people just think that measles, like
chickenpox, is part of being a child and it's so not.

'[SLJ] didn't need to die and that's the guilt I carry every day with
me.'

Health Secretary Victoria Atkins said rising measles cases will be a
'cause of concern for many' and stressed that unvaccinated children
were at risk of serious illness.

But she added: 'The good news is the MMR vaccine offers extremely high
protection against this nasty virus, as well as mumps and rubella.

'The vaccine is completely safe. It will boost immunity and stamp out
this disease once and for all.

'It will also mean children can go back to doing what they should be
doing, playing with friends, spending time with family and going to
school.=20

If you are not sure if your child has been fully vaccinated, you can
check their little red book or call your GP surgery.'

NHS England has issued healthcare workers with infection control
guidance on measles for the 1st time.=20

It says patients should be isolated on arrival at a GP surgery and
appointments should be arranged to reduce waiting times in reception
areas.=20

In hospitals, suspected measles patients should also be put in a
separate area -- ideally a single room away from others.

Parents are being warned of a steep rise in cases of an extremely
infectious and potentially deadly disease in Birmingham, which can
have severe and potentially life-threatening consequences in children.
Measles cases are rising daily in the city and there are fears cases
could increase rapidly this week as children return to school after
the Christmas break.

The UK Health Security Agency has confirmed there have been 133
lab-confirmed cases in the West Midlands since 1 Oct 2023 with another
96 'likely cases' -- a total of 229. Around 80% of those have been
seen in Birmingham, and 10% in Coventry with other areas also in the
region now being affected.

Measles starts with cold-like symptoms the NHS says, which are
followed by a rash, with some people getting small spots in their
mouth. Other symptoms include getting a high temperature (which can
reach 40 degrees C [104 F]), a runny or blocked nose, sneezing, a
cough and red, sore watery eyes.

UKHSA health professionals are concerned cases will now rise quickly
as children return to school, particularly as the uptake of the MMR
(measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine is 'worryingly low' in some parts
of the West Midlands. Most of the measles cases being seen in the West
Midlands are in younger children who have not had their MMR vaccines,
with some needing hospital treatment the Government health agency
said.

Cllr Rob Pocock (Sutton Vesey, Lab.) who is Birmingham's acting
cabinet member for health and social care put a message on X, formerly
known as Twitter, and said: "Public Health Alert - measles outbreak
intensifying. Now over 180 cases in Birmingham, and nationwide a
National Incident has been declared today [11 Jan 2024]."

Cllr Pocock told BirminghamLive: "There were 80 cases before Christmas
and before schools went back it was 150. Yesterday (10 Jan 2024) the
number reported was 180. The big issue this week is kids are back to
school and we are expecting a surge.

"The scale of the spread will be known by the start of next week. The
issue is tied in with the MMR vaccination rate. There's a geographic
and demographic problem. There's still stuff going around that if
you're Muslim, it's pork and you can't have it. But there are 2
versions.

"In some areas of the city the MMR vaccination rates are struggling to
get to 80%. The main problems are in Birmingham east. Now it's a
watching brief to wait and see if the situation deteriorates. Schools
will be doing their very best to keep out people with measles
infections. If cases double and double again, then we have a big, big
problem.

"Parents should look for symptons, get their children vaccinated if
they aren't and those with suspected symptoms don't go to a medical
facility, call 111, go online or call their GP."

How serious is measles?
-----------------------
Measles is highly infectious among those who are not vaccinated, with
every person infecting to 10 to 20 others, far more than those with
COVID infected. The disease spreads when a person sneezes or coughs
and can be easily caught by breathing on those droplets, or touching a
surface where the droplets are and placing your hand near your mouth
or nose. It can survive on surfaces for several hours.

For most symptoms will last for 7 to 10 days without causing further
problems. But it also has the potential to cause serious problems,
like pneumonia, meningitis, blindness and seizures, and can be
deadly.

Those most at risk from complications are children under the age of 5,
children with a poor diet and those with a weakened immune system. And
also pregnant women and adults over the age of 20.

Children who have not been vaccinated and who have come into contact
with someone with measles can be excluded from school for 21 days --
the potential incubation period of the disease.

Dr Neil Bugg, deputy medical director at Birmingham Women's and
Children's NHS Foundation Trust, said: "At our hospital, we see the
most severe cases of measles, which can lead to more serious
conditions such as pneumonia, an infection of the lungs, encephalitis,
which is swelling of the brain and other serious complications.

"The very best way to be protected is to have the MMR vaccine, which
is available from your GP. We'd like for everyone to be vaccinated
against measles if they haven't been already, so that they are
protected against these rare but potentially very serious
complications."

How do you protect against measles?
-----------------------------------
Vaccination is via 2 doses of MMR which is free and 'very effective
against measles' as well as protecting against mumps and rubella. The
1st dose is given just after a child's 1st birthday and the 2nd at 3
years 4 months before children go to school. It is part of the routine
childhood vaccine schedule but in some areas the uptake is as low as
5%.

Dr Naveed Syed, UKHSA West Midlands consultant in health protection,
said: "We are seeing cases of measles rising every day in the West
Midlands. The virus is very infectious and can spread rapidly among
communities, such as schools, if people have not had at least one dose
of the MMR vaccine.

Uptake of MMR in the region is much lower than the 95% needed to
protect the population, which is giving this serious disease a chance
to get a foothold in our communities. That's why it's vital that
anyone who hasn't had 2 doses of the MMR vaccine by the time they
started full time school gets immunised as soon as possible.

"We have advised schools that anyone who has not had at least one dose
of MMR and has been in contact with a case of measles could be
excluded from school for 21 days -- the time it can take for symptoms
to develop, while still passing the infection to others.

"People may not realise how severe measles can be. While most people
will recover completely within a couple of weeks, the virus can cause
serious illness -- sometimes this can leave permanent disability and
it can even cause death. People in certain at-risk groups, including
babies and small children, pregnant women, and people with weakened
immunity, are at increased risk of complications if they catch
measles."

Anyone who has missed out on the vaccine in childhood can get it at
any age. And there is a version with no pork gelatine in its
production, available on request for those who are not allowed pork
for religious reasons. Parents are advised to check their child's Red
Book to see if they have had the MMR vaccine or to check with their
GP.

What should you do if you get measles?
--------------------------------------
Those suffering should rest and drink plenty of fluids, take
paracetamol or ibuprofen to relieve a high temperature and use cotton
wool soaked in warm water to remove any crusts from eyes. And anyone
displaying symptoms must stay away from medical facilities.

Dr Syed added: "If you think you could have measles, it's really
important to stay away from areas where you could come into contact
with lots of other people -- especially vulnerable patients in
hospitals, care homes or other healthcare settings.

"If you have the symptoms of measles, it is essential that you don't
just turn up at your GP practice, walk in centre or other healthcare
provider. Instead, contact your GP or NHS111 for advice. If you do
need to visit a healthcare setting, please phone ahead so arrangements
can be made to prevent other people being infected."

[Another report (<https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-67947095>) noted
measles cases in West Midlands haven't been this high since the 1990s
which is telling, especially when so many countries to include the UK
had nearly or completely eliminated locally acquired measles. It will
be interesting to see how quickly the national incident declaration
mobilizes vaccination and education resources and the impact of such
measures versus the entrenched vaccine hesitancy/resistance in many
areas. - Mod.JH

accination drive is needed to ward off a growing wave of<br>measles outbrea=
ks, health chiefs said last night [18 Jan 2024].=0D<br>=0D<br>Declaring an =
official 'national incident', the UK Health Security<br>Agency warned that =
too few youngsters were protected against the<br>potentially deadly virus.=0D=
<br>=0D<br>Jenny Harries, the agency's chief executive, urged parents to ch=
eck<br>whether their children had had the measles, mumps and rubella jab an=
d<br>said the UK was on a 'trajectory for everything getting much worse'.=20=0D=
<br>=0D<br>It is a far cry from 2016, when Britain was declared measles-fre=
e by<br>the World Health Organisation.=0D<br>=0D<br>The disease, which caus=
es flu-like symptoms and a nasty rash, proves<br>fatal in roughly 1 in ever=
y 5000 cases.=20=0D<br>=0D<br>Vaccination rates have fallen across the coun=
try with London and the<br>West Midlands among the worst regions.=0D<br>=0D=
<br>The latter has had more than 300 confirmed and probable cases since 1<b=
r>Oct 2023. Most victims were under 10.=20=0D<br>=0D<br>The declaration of =
a national incident signifies a growing public<br>health risk and enables t=
he agency to focus work in specific<br>locations.=0D<br>=0D<br>Dame Jenny t=
old BBC Radio 4's Today programme the vaccination<br>programme was 'clearly=
 not' at the right level.=0D<br>=0D<br>The professor added: 'We had establi=
shed measles elimination status in<br>the UK, but in fact our vaccination r=
ates now have dropped on average<br>to about only 85% of children arriving =
at school having had the 2 MMR<br>doses.=0D<br>=0D<br>'In the West Midlands=
, that's in some areas down to 81%. If we go down<br>to the Surrey Heartlan=
ds integrated care board area, that's just over<br>70%.=0D<br>=0D<br>'So we=
 are well under the recommended coverage for MMR vaccination<br>that the Wo=
rld Health Organisation recommends.=20=0D<br>=0D<br>'We want it to be 95% c=
overage. We need a call to action right across<br>the country.=0D<br>=0D<br=
>'Colleagues across the West Midlands have worked tirelessly to try to<br>c=
ontrol the outbreak, but with vaccine uptake in some communities so<br>low,=
 there is now a very real risk of seeing the virus spread in other<br>towns=
 and cities.'=0D<br>=0D<br>Last year [2023] 84.5% of youngsters in England =
had received both MMR<br>doses by the time they were 5 - the lowest rate si=
nce 2010/11 - and<br>92.5% had received at least one dose.=0D<br>=0D<br>Exp=
erts attribute the fall in uptake to anti-vax sentiment, pandemic<br>disrup=
tion and a discredited 1998 study suggesting a link between the<br>MMR jab =
and autism.=0D<br>=0D<br>Dame Jenny said some Muslim communities had shunne=
d the MMR vaccine<br>because it contains ingredients derived from pork -- b=
ut she stressed<br>vegan versions were available.=0D<br>=0D<br>She added: '=
It's quite common with vaccination programmes that when<br>the risk is perc=
eived to have gone away, then the concern to get<br>vaccinated may drop off=
 and so one of the reasons for flagging this is<br>to remind people that ca=
ses are still out there. This is a serious<br>illness.'=0D<br>=0D<br>The di=
re consequences of measles were last night [18 Jan 2024]<br>highlighted by =
[GLJ], whose 6-year-old son [SLJ] died from a brain<br>inflammation caused =
by measles in 2019.=0D<br>=0D<br>Sharing her story to encourage parents to =
vaccinate more, she said: 'I<br>honestly do believe that people just think =
that measles, like<br>chickenpox, is part of being a child and it's so not.=0D=
<br>=0D<br>'[SLJ] didn't need to die and that's the guilt I carry every day=
 with<br>me.'=0D<br>=0D<br>Health Secretary Victoria Atkins said rising mea=
sles cases will be a<br>'cause of concern for many' and stressed that unvac=
cinated children<br>were at risk of serious illness.=0D<br>=0D<br>But she a=
dded: 'The good news is the MMR vaccine offers extremely high<br>protection=
 against this nasty virus, as well as mumps and rubella.=0D<br>=0D<br>'The =
vaccine is completely safe. It will boost immunity and stamp out<br>this di=
sease once and for all.=0D<br>=0D<br>'It will also mean children can go bac=

e with family and going to<br>school.=20=0D<br>=0D<br>If you are not sure i=
f your child has been fully vaccinated, you can<br>check their little red b=

 are being warned of a steep rise in cases of an extremely<br>infectious an=
d potentially deadly disease in Birmingham, which can<br>have severe and po=
tentially life-threatening consequences in children.<br>Measles cases are r=
ising daily in the city and there are fears cases<br>could increase rapidly=
 this week as children return to school after<br>the Christmas break.=0D<br=
>=0D<br>The UK Health Security Agency has confirmed there have been 133<br>=
lab-confirmed cases in the West Midlands since 1 Oct 2023 with another<br>9=
6 'likely cases' -- a total of 229. Around 80% of those have been<br>seen i=
n Birmingham, and 10% in Coventry with other areas also in the<br>region no=
w being affected.=0D<br>=0D<br>Measles starts with cold-like symptoms the N=
HS says, which are<br>followed by a rash, with some people getting small sp=
ots in their<br>mouth. Other symptoms include getting a high temperature (w=
hich can<br>reach 40 degrees C [104 F]), a runny or blocked nose, sneezing,=
 a<br>cough and red, sore watery eyes.=0D<br>=0D<br>UKHSA health profession=
als are concerned cases will now rise quickly<br>as children return to scho=
ol, particularly as the uptake of the MMR<br>(measles, mumps and rubella) v=
accine is 'worryingly low' in some parts<br>of the West Midlands. Most of t=
he measles cases being seen in the West<br>Midlands are in younger children=
 who have not had their MMR vaccines,<br>with some needing hospital treatme=
nt the Government health agency<br>said.=0D<br>=0D<br>Cllr Rob Pocock (Sutt=
on Vesey, Lab.) who is Birmingham's acting<br>cabinet member for health and=
 social care put a message on X, formerly<br>known as Twitter, and said: "P=
ublic Health Alert - measles outbreak<br>intensifying. Now over 180 cases i=
n Birmingham, and nationwide a<br>National Incident has been declared today=
 [11 Jan 2024]."=0D<br>=0D<br>Cllr Pocock told BirminghamLive: "There were =
80 cases before Christmas<br>and before schools went back it was 150. Yeste=

is kids are back to<br>school and we are expecting a surge.=0D<br>=0D<br>"T=
he scale of the spread will be known by the start of next week. The<br>issu=
e is tied in with the MMR vaccination rate. There's a geographic<br>and dem=
ographic problem. There's still stuff going around that if<br>you're Muslim=
, it's pork and you can't have it. But there are 2<br>versions.=0D<br>=0D<b=
r>"In some areas of the city the MMR vaccination rates are struggling to<br=
>get to 80%. The main problems are in Birmingham east. Now it's a<br>watchi=
ng brief to wait and see if the situation deteriorates. Schools<br>will be =
doing their very best to keep out people with measles<br>infections. If cas=
es double and double again, then we have a big, big<br>problem.=0D<br>=0D<b=
r>"Parents should look for symptons, get their children vaccinated if<br>th=

les?=0D<br>-----------------------=0D<br>Measles is highly infectious among=
 those who are not vaccinated, with<br>every person infecting to 10 to 20 o=
thers, far more than those with<br>COVID infected. The disease spreads when=
 a person sneezes or coughs<br>and can be easily caught by breathing on tho=
se droplets, or touching a<br>surface where the droplets are and placing yo=
ur hand near your mouth<br>or nose. It can survive on surfaces for several =
hours.=0D<br>=0D<br>For most symptoms will last for 7 to 10 days without ca=
using further<br>problems. But it also has the potential to cause serious p=
roblems,<br>like pneumonia, meningitis, blindness and seizures, and can be<=
br>deadly.=0D<br>=0D<br>Those most at risk from complications are children =
under the age of 5,<br>children with a poor diet and those with a weakened =
immune system. And<br>also pregnant women and adults over the age of 20.=0D=
<br>=0D<br>Children who have not been vaccinated and who have come into con=
tact<br>with someone with measles can be excluded from school for 21 days -=
-<br>the potential incubation period of the disease.=0D<br>=0D<br>Dr Neil B=
ugg, deputy medical director at Birmingham Women's and<br>Children's NHS Fo=
undation Trust, said: "At our hospital, we see the<br>most severe cases of =
measles, which can lead to more serious<br>conditions such as pneumonia, an=
 infection of the lungs, encephalitis,<br>which is swelling of the brain an=
d other serious complications.=0D<br>=0D<br>"The very best way to be protec=
ted is to have the MMR vaccine, which<br>is available from your GP. We'd li=
