SALMONELLOSIS, MULTIPLE SEROTYPES - ITALY: HORSE MEAT, HUMAN, 2021

A study of _Salmonella_ in horses in Italy has uncovered an outbreak
that affected 17 people. From June to November 2021, 146 horses, 5
donkeys, and 1 mule were tested for _Salmonella_ in cecal contents and
through carcass swabs from one slaughterhouse. _Salmonella_ was
detected 3 times in 152 of the cecal contents, while all 152 carcass
samples were negative.

According to the study published in the International Journal of Food
Microbiology, _Salmonella_ Enteritidis, Typhimurium, and Stanleyville
were identified. Countries of horse origin were France, Italy, Poland,
Hungary, Slovenia, and Germany. They were slaughtered twice a week but
arrived at the slaughterhouse daily.

_Salmonella_ was detected in June 2021 and late September 2021. A
total of 9 horses were tested in June [2021], and 2 cecal samples were
positive for _Salmonella_ Enteritidis and Stanleyville. These animals
came from Hungary and Italy. In September 2021, 7 were tested, and the
positive one, from Italy, carried _Salmonella_ Typhimurium.

Considering the consumption of ground horse meat called "pesto di
cavallo" and dried and smoked strips named "sfilacci di cavallo" in
northern Italy, researchers investigated the link between horse meat
and human salmonellosis in this area. In July 2021, whole genome
sequencing-based surveillance in Emilia-Romagna signaled a potential
outbreak of _Salmonella_ Enteritidis, including 9 isolates across
Piacenza, Parma, and Reggio-Emilia provinces. The first isolate came
from May 2021, and the last came from August. In June 2021, a genomic
match was found between the _Salmonella_ Enteritidis isolated from
horse cecal content and an outbreak of 17 cases in Emilia-Romagna.

Epidemiological investigations highlighted some cases of reported
consumption of horse meat. They traced different batches of the meat,
released weeks apart from each other, to the slaughter site in the
study. Five of 8 cases reported eating uncooked horse meat. Horse meat
associated with cases and traced to the slaughterhouse was produced in
May and June 2021, while the horse carrying the outbreak strain of
_Salmonella_ Enteritidis was slaughtered weeks later, in June 2021.
This means meat from that animal could not have infected those cases.

Scientists said the outbreak strain was likely already present in the
slaughterhouse environment before the horse arrived from Hungary and
that environmental persistence could have caused contamination. The
environment could have been contaminated before June [2021] and have
affected meat produced in early May. Supporting this is the finding
that the last batch of horse meat associated with cases was from a
horse from France and slaughtered 2 weeks before the Hungarian animal
in June 2021. It appears unlikely that 2 horses from different
countries slaughtered 2 weeks apart carried the same WGS type of
_Salmonella_, said researchers.

An official visit to the slaughter plant found manure on the floor,
dirty troughs, and pests in the lairage area. Improvement of hygiene
measures at the lairage and along the slaughter line was demanded. The
company also increased the number of carcasses routinely tested for
surface contamination by _Salmonella_. Scientists said despite
findings showing a low prevalence, _Salmonella_ in horse meat can
represent a consumer risk.

"A key lesson from the study concerns the need to maintain a high
level of hygiene during the entire slaughtering process. Hygiene at
lairage (an accommodation for farm animals) is crucial to avoid
cross-contamination between animals and the meat. For this reason,
lairage conditions should be critically evaluated, and biosecurity
measures must be properly implemented."

Abstract
--------
"The study assessed the role of equids at slaughter as faecal carriers
of _Salmonella enterica_ and the occurrence of contaminated equid
carcasses during the slaughter process in Northern Italy
(Emilia-Romagna Region). From June to November 2021, 152 equids (146
horses, 5 donkeys and 1 mule) were tested for _Salmonella_ both in
caecal contents and through carcass swabs. Antimicrobial resistance
(AMR) of recovered strains was tested against 15 antimicrobials.
_Salmonella_ was detected in 3 of 152 of the caecal contents (2.0%),
while all carcass samples were negative. _S. enterica_ serovars
Enteriditis, Typhimurium and Stanleyville were identified. The only
AMR isolate was _S._ Typhimurium with AMR profile AmCStxT.

"Considering the consumption of raw horse meat (i.e., minced raw meat
named 'pesto di cavallo' and dried and smoked strips named 'sfilacci
di cavallo') in different areas of Northern Italy, we also
investigated the possible link between horse meat eating and
salmonellosis cases in the human population in the same area.
Specifically, we compared the _Salmonella_ strains collected during
the study with those routinely processed in the laboratory
surveillance system for human salmonellosis in Emilia-Romagna (a
region with about 4.5 million inhabitants). The comparison was based
on whole genome sequencing data through core genome multi-locus
sequence typing (cgMLST) used in routine surveillance. A genomic match
in cgMLST was found between the strain of _S. enterica_ serovar
Enteritidis isolated from a horse caecal content and an enduring
outbreak of 17 human cases in Emilia-Romagna during the study period.
The consequent epidemiological investigation highlighted that a number
of cases with known food history reported the consumption of horse
meat and traced different batches of the consumed meat, released weeks
apart from each other, to the slaughter investigated in the study. The
results of the epidemiological investigation suggested the role of
horses in the _S. enterica_ serovar Enteritidis outbreak affecting raw
horse meat consumers.

"This study shows that, despite the low prevalence on equid carcasses,
_S. enterica_ in horse meat can represent a risk to consumers. From
the perspective of the slaughter activities, this highlights the need
to maintain a high level of hygiene during the entire process,
starting from the hygiene at lairage up to the slaughtering phase and
dressing of carcasses."

Although not often considered as a source of salmonellosis, equines
can certainly be on the menu of zoonoses for this pathogen as shown by
the following report:

isolated from horses, wild turkeys, and an edible home garden

Summary
------
"In July 2010, a horse from a rural farm (Farm A) in coastal Northern
California was diagnosed with _Salmonella_ Oranienburg infection
following referral to a veterinary hospital for colic surgery.
Environmental sampling to identify potential sources and persistence
of _Salmonella_ on the farm was conducted from August 2010 to March
2011. _Salmonella_ was cultured using standard enrichment and
selective plating. Pure colonies were confirmed by biochemical
analysis, serotyped, and compared by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis
(PFGE) analysis. A total of 204 clinical and environmental samples at
Farm A were analyzed, and _Salmonella_ spp. were isolated from 6 of 8
(75%) horses, an asymptomatic pet dog, 2 of 7 (28.6%) water samples
from horse troughs, 9 of 20 (45%) manure storage pile composites, 16
of 71 (22.5%) wild turkey feces, and 4 of 39 (10.3%) soil samples from
the family's edible home garden. Well water and garden vegetable
samples and horse fecal samples from a neighboring ranch were
negative. _S._ Oranienburg with a PFGE pattern indistinguishable from
the horse clinical strain was found in all positive sample types on
Farm A. The investigation illustrates the potential for widespread
dissemination of _Salmonella_ in a farm environment following equine
infections. We speculate that a recent surge in the wild turkey
population on the property could have introduced _S._ Oranienburg into
the herd, although we cannot rule out the possibility wild turkeys
were exposed on the farm or to other potential sources of
_Salmonella_. Findings from the investigation indicated that raw horse
manure applied as fertilizer was the most likely source of garden soil

2024/01/scientists-uncover-salmonella-outbreak-linked-to-horse-meat/</a>=0D=
<br>=0D<br>=0D<br>A study of _Salmonella_ in horses in Italy has uncovered =
an outbreak<br>that affected 17 people. From June to November 2021, 146 hor=
ses, 5<br>donkeys, and 1 mule were tested for _Salmonella_ in cecal content=
s and<br>through carcass swabs from one slaughterhouse. _Salmonella_ was<br=
>detected 3 times in 152 of the cecal contents, while all 152 carcass<br>sa=
mples were negative.=0D<br>=0D<br>According to the study published in the I=
nternational Journal of Food<br>Microbiology, _Salmonella_ Enteritidis, Typ=
himurium, and Stanleyville<br>were identified. Countries of horse origin we=
re France, Italy, Poland,<br>Hungary, Slovenia, and Germany. They were slau=
ghtered twice a week but<br>arrived at the slaughterhouse daily.=0D<br>=0D<=
br>_Salmonella_ was detected in June 2021 and late September 2021. A<br>tot=
al of 9 horses were tested in June [2021], and 2 cecal samples were<br>posi=
tive for _Salmonella_ Enteritidis and Stanleyville. These animals<br>came f=
rom Hungary and Italy. In September 2021, 7 were tested, and the<br>positiv=
e one, from Italy, carried _Salmonella_ Typhimurium.=0D<br>=0D<br>Consideri=
ng the consumption of ground horse meat called "pesto di<br>cavallo" and dr=
ied and smoked strips named "sfilacci di cavallo" in<br>northern Italy, res=
earchers investigated the link between horse meat<br>and human salmonellosi=
s in this area. In July 2021, whole genome<br>sequencing-based surveillance=
 in Emilia-Romagna signaled a potential<br>outbreak of _Salmonella_ Enterit=
idis, including 9 isolates across<br>Piacenza, Parma, and Reggio-Emilia pro=
vinces. The first isolate came<br>from May 2021, and the last came from Aug=
ust. In June 2021, a genomic<br>match was found between the _Salmonella_ En=
teritidis isolated from<br>horse cecal content and an outbreak of 17 cases =
in Emilia-Romagna.=0D<br>=0D<br>Epidemiological investigations highlighted =
some cases of reported<br>consumption of horse meat. They traced different =
batches of the meat,<br>released weeks apart from each other, to the slaugh=
ter site in the<br>study. Five of 8 cases reported eating uncooked horse me=
at. Horse meat<br>associated with cases and traced to the slaughterhouse wa=
s produced in<br>May and June 2021, while the horse carrying the outbreak s=
train of<br>_Salmonella_ Enteritidis was slaughtered weeks later, in June 2=
021.<br>This means meat from that animal could not have infected those case=
s.=0D<br>=0D<br>Scientists said the outbreak strain was likely already pres=
ent in the<br>slaughterhouse environment before the horse arrived from Hung=
ary and<br>that environmental persistence could have caused contamination. =
The<br>environment could have been contaminated before June [2021] and have=
<br>affected meat produced in early May. Supporting this is the finding<br>=
that the last batch of horse meat associated with cases was from a<br>horse=
 from France and slaughtered 2 weeks before the Hungarian animal<br>in June=
 2021. It appears unlikely that 2 horses from different<br>countries slaugh=
tered 2 weeks apart carried the same WGS type of<br>_Salmonella_, said rese=
archers.=0D<br>=0D<br>An official visit to the slaughter plant found manure=
 on the floor,<br>dirty troughs, and pests in the lairage area. Improvement=
 of hygiene<br>measures at the lairage and along the slaughter line was dem=
anded. The<br>company also increased the number of carcasses routinely test=
ed for<br>surface contamination by _Salmonella_. Scientists said despite<br=
>findings showing a low prevalence, _Salmonella_ in horse meat can<br>repre=
sent a consumer risk.=0D<br>=0D<br>"A key lesson from the study concerns th=
e need to maintain a high<br>level of hygiene during the entire slaughterin=
g process. Hygiene at<br>lairage (an accommodation for farm animals) is cru=
cial to avoid<br>cross-contamination between animals and the meat. For this=
 reason,<br>lairage conditions should be critically evaluated, and biosecur=
ity<br>measures must be properly implemented."=0D<br>=0D<br>[Byline: Joe Wh=

"The study assessed the role of equids at slaughter as faecal carriers<br>o=
f _Salmonella enterica_ and the occurrence of contaminated equid<br>carcass=
es during the slaughter process in Northern Italy<br>(Emilia-Romagna Region=
). From June to November 2021, 152 equids (146<br>horses, 5 donkeys and 1 m=
ule) were tested for _Salmonella_ both in<br>caecal contents and through ca=
rcass swabs. Antimicrobial resistance<br>(AMR) of recovered strains was tes=
ted against 15 antimicrobials.<br>_Salmonella_ was detected in 3 of 152 of =
the caecal contents (2.0%),<br>while all carcass samples were negative. _S.=
 enterica_ serovars<br>Enteriditis, Typhimurium and Stanleyville were ident=
ified. The only<br>AMR isolate was _S._ Typhimurium with AMR profile AmCStx=
T.=0D<br>=0D<br>"Considering the consumption of raw horse meat (i.e., mince=
d raw meat<br>named 'pesto di cavallo' and dried and smoked strips named 's=
filacci<br>di cavallo') in different areas of Northern Italy, we also<br>in=
vestigated the possible link between horse meat eating and<br>salmonellosis=
 cases in the human population in the same area.<br>Specifically, we compar=
ed the _Salmonella_ strains collected during<br>the study with those routin=
ely processed in the laboratory<br>surveillance system for human salmonello=
sis in Emilia-Romagna (a<br>region with about 4.5 million inhabitants). The=
 comparison was based<br>on whole genome sequencing data through core genom=
e multi-locus<br>sequence typing (cgMLST) used in routine surveillance. A g=
enomic match<br>in cgMLST was found between the strain of _S. enterica_ ser=
ovar<br>Enteritidis isolated from a horse caecal content and an enduring<br=
>outbreak of 17 human cases in Emilia-Romagna during the study period.<br>T=
he consequent epidemiological investigation highlighted that a number<br>of=
 cases with known food history reported the consumption of horse<br>meat an=
d traced different batches of the consumed meat, released weeks<br>apart fr=
om each other, to the slaughter investigated in the study. The<br>results o=
f the epidemiological investigation suggested the role of<br>horses in the =
_S. enterica_ serovar Enteritidis outbreak affecting raw<br>horse meat cons=
umers.=0D<br>=0D<br>"This study shows that, despite the low prevalence on e=
quid carcasses,<br>_S. enterica_ in horse meat can represent a risk to cons=
umers. From<br>the perspective of the slaughter activities, this highlights=
 the need<br>to maintain a high level of hygiene during the entire process,=

r>Summary=0D<br>------=0D<br>"In July 2010, a horse from a rural farm (Farm=
 A) in coastal Northern<br>California was diagnosed with _Salmonella_ Orani=
enburg infection<br>following referral to a veterinary hospital for colic s=
urgery.<br>Environmental sampling to identify potential sources and persist=
ence<br>of _Salmonella_ on the farm was conducted from August 2010 to March=
<br>2011. _Salmonella_ was cultured using standard enrichment and<br>select=
ive plating. Pure colonies were confirmed by biochemical<br>analysis, serot=
yped, and compared by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis<br>(PFGE) analysis. =
A total of 204 clinical and environmental samples at<br>Farm A were analyze=
d, and _Salmonella_ spp. were isolated from 6 of 8<br>(75%) horses, an asym=
ptomatic pet dog, 2 of 7 (28.6%) water samples<br>from horse troughs, 9 of =
20 (45%) manure storage pile composites, 16<br>of 71 (22.5%) wild turkey fe=
ces, and 4 of 39 (10.3%) soil samples from<br>the family's edible home gard=
en. Well water and garden vegetable<br>samples and horse fecal samples from=
 a neighboring ranch were<br>negative. _S._ Oranienburg with a PFGE pattern=
 indistinguishable from<br>the horse clinical strain was found in all posit=
ive sample types on<br>Farm A. The investigation illustrates the potential =
for widespread<br>dissemination of _Salmonella_ in a farm environment follo=
wing equine<br>infections. We speculate that a recent surge in the wild tur=
key<br>population on the property could have introduced _S._ Oranienburg in=
to<br>the herd, although we cannot rule out the possibility wild turkeys<br=
>were exposed on the farm or to other potential sources of<br>_Salmonella_.=
 Findings from the investigation indicated that raw horse<br>manure applied=
 as fertilizer was the most likely source of garden soil<br>contamination. =
Viable _S._ Oranienburg persisted in garden soil for an<br>estimated 210 da=
ys, which exceeds the 120-day standard between<br>application and harvest c=
urrently required by the National Organic<br>Program. The study underscores=
 the need to educate the public about<br>potential food safety hazards asso=
ciated with using raw animal manure<br>to fertilize edible home gardens."=0D=
