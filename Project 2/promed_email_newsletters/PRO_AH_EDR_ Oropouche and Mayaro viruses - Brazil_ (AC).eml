OROPOUCHE AND MAYARO VIRUSES - BRAZIL: (ACRE)
*********************************************
A ProMED-mail post

Acre reached 60 confirmed cases of Oropouche and Mayaro infections,
detected in 10 municipalities in the last month of 2023. According to
data provided to G1 by the Acre State Department of Health (Sesacre),
the state reached 60 cases by 2 Dec 2023.

As a result, Acre recorded an increase in relation to the first total
released by Sesacre in November last year [2023]. Up to then, there
were 6 cities with confirmed cases, with 48 recorded cases in total.

The first registered cases of these infections occurred in April
[2023]. According to the survey, the cases were detected in the
following municipalities.

Oropouche:
Location / No. cases
--------------------
Acrel=E2ndia / 8
Brasil=E9ia / 1
Feij=F3 / 3 (does not appear in the first total count)
Manoel Urbano / 8 (+5 cases)
Porto Acre / 5
Rio Branco / 32
Sena Madureira / 1

Mayaro:
Location / No. cases
--------------------
Cruzeiro do Sul / 3
M=E2ncio Lima / 1 (does not appear in the first total count)
Rio Branco / 1

The 2 viruses cause symptoms similar to those of dengue, transmitted
by the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito. Mayaro is even called chikungunya's
"cousin." (See the symptoms below).

Oropouche fever is an arbovirus, that is, a virus transmitted by
mosquitoes, which presents symptoms similar to dengue, although with a
much lower risk of bleeding complications and death. Rarely, cases may
be complicated by viral (benign) meningitis. The main mosquito that
transmits the disease among humans is _Culicoides paraensis_, better
known as "maruim." Preventive measures consist of avoiding their
proliferation of and contact with these mosquitoes, similar to
precautions against dengue fever.

Mayaro is endemic (has a continuous presence) in Amazonia and is
normally transmitted by mosquitoes of the _Haemagogus_ genus, which
live in the forests and are also known for spreading sylvan [forest]
yellow fever. It is a different profile from _Aedes aegypti_, the
vector of dengue, zika, chikungunya and urban yellow fever -- as it
lives in cities.

"They are febrile syndromes and are very similar to the symptoms of
dengue, with fever, body pain, pain behind the eyes and we are
noticing that there are cases with symptoms on the skin. People are
appearing with spots on the skin too. The exam only showed negative
for dengue and we decided to test the differential diagnosis, as we
call it," explained the head of the Health Surveillance Department,
Edvan Meneses, at the time of the release of the first report.

The coordinator highlighted that Acre had not recorded cases of the
virus in the urban areas for a long time. He highlighted that the
cases were found more in rural areas, and explained the possible
reasons for the locality of infections. "It could be due to the fact
that the city is deeper into the forest, but also due to changes in
the mosquito's life cycle. Now, we are realizing that there are more
houses, we saw that a lot of people went hunting [in the forest], as
is the case with yellow fever. This is surprising for us to notice
[cases] in urban areas, where we find more dengue, zika and
chikungunya," he confirmed.

Because of the lack of confirmation in urban areas, the coordinator
said that the Ministry of Health did not send samples for tests. "We
couldn't know in a broad sense because we didn't test because it
wasn't [recognized as] an endemic disease here. We may have had cases,
but they were underreported due to lack of testing," he said.

With the new recorded cases, the specialist said that a reorganization
of the health network will be carried out with training of
professionals, lectures and alerts about viruses to begin the work of
raising awareness and combating infections.

"They were isolated cases; we didn't have that number of cases in the
urban area. It's not a new disease, but it wasn't in our area. We're
going to train the entire network about Mayaro and Oropouche, even the
names are difficult, so it's a whole movement for training our
network, reorganization, leaving the diagnosis to the units, the
medication and it was something we were not expecting. There are 2
more arboviruses for us to work on during this epidemiological
period," he said.

Symptoms
--------
Oropouche virus [infection]:
- Fever
- Headache
- Pain in the body and joints
- In some cases, the patient may experience vomiting

Mayaro virus [infection]:
- Fever
- Headache
- Body and joint pain
- In some cases, the patient may experience vomiting

The infection generates symptoms similar to those caused by
chikungunya [virus infection], such as high fever and joint pain,
which makes diagnosis difficult.

[Given the large numbers of dengue cases in Brazil and the recent
chikungunya  and Zika virus outbreaks there, it is not surprising that
these 3 viruses probably have been the default diagnosis in febrile
cases, often without laboratory confirmation, as the above report
mentions. The result is that Oropouche and Mayaro virus infections are
almost certainly underreported not only in Brazil but in the tropical
Americas where the respective arthropod vectors occur.

Oropouche virus [OROV] is endemic in the Amazon Basin, and human cases
have been documented in Brazil, Peru, Ecuador, Panama, and Trinidad
and Tobago. Reports of cases in these countries have been sporadic but
likely underdiagnosed. Because fever with a rash is typical of dengue
fever, yellow fever, chikungunya, and Zika virus infections, timely
laboratory support is essential to make a differential diagnosis.

Although _Culicoides paraensis_, the vector of Oropouche virus, occurs
from the northern USA to Argentina, human cases have been recognized
only in the Amazon Basin and Trinidad and Tobago. One wonders if there
is a possibility that cases are occurring in other countries where
this vector midge is found, but go undiagnosed or misdiagnosed as
dengue fever, yellow fever, chikungunya, or Zika virus infections.
Perhaps OROV diagnostic capability in all tropical areas where the
vector occurs would reveal more cases.

An image of _Culicoides paraensis_ can be seen at

Mayaro virus (MAYV) is endemic in Brazil. It has been found to cause
human disease in Par=E1 state and in other areas in Brazil. The first
report of Mayaro virus cases was in 1955, in an outbreak in Par=E1
state, Brazil. In 2011, thousands of cases of Mayaro fever were
reported in an outbreak that occurred in Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil.

As Mod.JT noted in an early ProMED post (20110220.0557), MAYV, of the
_Alphavirus_ genus, Togaviridae family, is endemic in tropical areas
of South America (Trinidad, Suriname, French Guyana, Brazil, Peru,
Bolivia, and Venezuela). In 2016, a MAYV infection occurred in a child
in Haiti. The transmission cycle is very similar to that of the yellow
fever virus, using primates as reservoirs and _Haemagogus_ mosquitoes
as vectors.

MAYV has been associated with a variety of mosquitoes that are
possible vectors that can transmit it to humans. MAYV has been
isolated from _Aedes aegypti_ and _Culex quinquefasciatus_ captured in
the field in Brazil. _Anopheles_ mosquitoes have been implicated as
important virus vectors (see references below).

]. Up to then, there<br>were 6 cities with confirmed cases, with 48 recorde=
d cases in total.=0D<br>=0D<br>The first registered cases of these infectio=

The 2 viruses cause symptoms similar to those of dengue, transmitted<br>by =
the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito. Mayaro is even called chikungunya's<br>"cousi=
n." (See the symptoms below).=0D<br>=0D<br>Oropouche fever is an arbovirus,=
 that is, a virus transmitted by<br>mosquitoes, which presents symptoms sim=
ilar to dengue, although with a<br>much lower risk of bleeding complication=
s and death. Rarely, cases may<br>be complicated by viral (benign) meningit=
is. The main mosquito that<br>transmits the disease among humans is _Culico=
ides paraensis_, better<br>known as "maruim." Preventive measures consist o=
f avoiding their<br>proliferation of and contact with these mosquitoes, sim=
ilar to<br>precautions against dengue fever.=0D<br>=0D<br>Mayaro is endemic=
 (has a continuous presence) in Amazonia and is<br>normally transmitted by =
mosquitoes of the _Haemagogus_ genus, which<br>live in the forests and are =
also known for spreading sylvan [forest]<br>yellow fever. It is a different=
 profile from _Aedes aegypti_, the<br>vector of dengue, zika, chikungunya a=
nd urban yellow fever -- as it<br>lives in cities.=0D<br>=0D<br>"They are f=
ebrile syndromes and are very similar to the symptoms of<br>dengue, with fe=
ver, body pain, pain behind the eyes and we are<br>noticing that there are =
cases with symptoms on the skin. People are<br>appearing with spots on the =
skin too. The exam only showed negative<br>for dengue and we decided to tes=
t the differential diagnosis, as we<br>call it," explained the head of the =
Health Surveillance Department,<br>Edvan Meneses, at the time of the releas=
e of the first report.=0D<br>=0D<br>The coordinator highlighted that Acre h=
ad not recorded cases of the<br>virus in the urban areas for a long time. H=
e highlighted that the<br>cases were found more in rural areas, and explain=
ed the possible<br>reasons for the locality of infections. "It could be due=
 to the fact<br>that the city is deeper into the forest, but also due to ch=
anges in<br>the mosquito's life cycle. Now, we are realizing that there are=
 more<br>houses, we saw that a lot of people went hunting [in the forest], =
as<br>is the case with yellow fever. This is surprising for us to notice<br=
>[cases] in urban areas, where we find more dengue, zika and<br>chikungunya=
," he confirmed.=0D<br>=0D<br>Because of the lack of confirmation in urban =
areas, the coordinator<br>said that the Ministry of Health did not send sam=
ples for tests. "We<br>couldn't know in a broad sense because we didn't tes=
t because it<br>wasn't [recognized as] an endemic disease here. We may have=
 had cases,<br>but they were underreported due to lack of testing," he said=
.=0D<br>=0D<br>With the new recorded cases, the specialist said that a reor=
ganization<br>of the health network will be carried out with training of<br=
>professionals, lectures and alerts about viruses to begin the work of<br>r=
aising awareness and combating infections.=0D<br>=0D<br>"They were isolated=
 cases; we didn't have that number of cases in the<br>urban area. It's not =
a new disease, but it wasn't in our area. We're<br>going to train the entir=
e network about Mayaro and Oropouche, even the<br>names are difficult, so i=
t's a whole movement for training our<br>network, reorganization, leaving t=
he diagnosis to the units, the<br>medication and it was something we were n=
ot expecting. There are 2<br>more arboviruses for us to work on during this=
 epidemiological<br>period," he said.=0D<br>=0D<br>Symptoms=0D<br>--------=0D=

large numbers of dengue cases in Brazil and the recent<br>chikungunya  and =
Zika virus outbreaks there, it is not surprising that<br>these 3 viruses pr=
obably have been the default diagnosis in febrile<br>cases, often without l=
aboratory confirmation, as the above report<br>mentions. The result is that=
 Oropouche and Mayaro virus infections are<br>almost certainly underreporte=
d not only in Brazil but in the tropical<br>Americas where the respective a=
rthropod vectors occur.=0D<br>=0D<br>Oropouche virus [OROV] is endemic in t=
he Amazon Basin, and human cases<br>have been documented in Brazil, Peru, E=
cuador, Panama, and Trinidad<br>and Tobago. Reports of cases in these count=
ries have been sporadic but<br>likely underdiagnosed. Because fever with a =
rash is typical of dengue<br>fever, yellow fever, chikungunya, and Zika vir=
us infections, timely<br>laboratory support is essential to make a differen=
tial diagnosis.=0D<br>=0D<br>Although _Culicoides paraensis_, the vector of=
 Oropouche virus, occurs<br>from the northern USA to Argentina, human cases=
 have been recognized<br>only in the Amazon Basin and Trinidad and Tobago. =
One wonders if there<br>is a possibility that cases are occurring in other =
countries where<br>this vector midge is found, but go undiagnosed or misdia=
gnosed as<br>dengue fever, yellow fever, chikungunya, or Zika virus infecti=
ons.<br>Perhaps OROV diagnostic capability in all tropical areas where the<=
br>vector occurs would reveal more cases.=0D<br>=0D<br>An image of _Culicoi=

in Brazil. It has been found to cause<br>human disease in Par=E1 state and =
in other areas in Brazil. The first<br>report of Mayaro virus cases was in =
1955, in an outbreak in Par=E1<br>state, Brazil. In 2011, thousands of case=
s of Mayaro fever were<br>reported in an outbreak that occurred in Manaus, =
Amazonas, Brazil.=0D<br>=0D<br>As Mod.JT noted in an early ProMED post (201=
10220.0557), MAYV, of the<br>_Alphavirus_ genus, Togaviridae family, is end=
emic in tropical areas<br>of South America (Trinidad, Suriname, French Guya=
na, Brazil, Peru,<br>Bolivia, and Venezuela). In 2016, a MAYV infection occ=
urred in a child<br>in Haiti. The transmission cycle is very similar to tha=
t of the yellow<br>fever virus, using primates as reservoirs and _Haemagogu=
s_ mosquitoes<br>as vectors.=0D<br>=0D<br>MAYV has been associated with a v=
ariety of mosquitoes that are<br>possible vectors that can transmit it to h=
umans. MAYV has been<br>isolated from _Aedes aegypti_ and _Culex quinquefas=
ciatus_ captured in<br>the field in Brazil. _Anopheles_ mosquitoes have bee=
n implicated as<br>important virus vectors (see references below).=0D<br>=0D=
