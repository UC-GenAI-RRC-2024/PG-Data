As the cholera outbreak in Zambia continues to expand rapidly, efforts
are being stepped up to halt the spread of disease and save lives. A
vaccination campaign is currently underway targeting 1.5 million
people, including children, health workers, and people at high risk of
infection in the worst affected areas.

In partnership with Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, UNICEF, and others,
World Health Organization (WHO) is supporting the government to
effectively roll out the oral cholera vaccination campaign as well as
bolster ongoing outbreak control measures. More than 1.4 million
cholera vaccine doses have been delivered to the country to help stem
the outbreak, with another 200 000 additional doses for a total of
around 1.7 million doses approved by the WHO International
Coordinating Group on Vaccine Provision.

The government declared a new outbreak in October 2023, which began in
Lusaka province. As of 18 Jan 2024, 10 887 cases and 432 deaths were
reported across 9 of the country's 10 provinces. Lusaka, Central, and
Eastern provinces are the worst affected. Lusaka district is the
epicentre of the outbreak. The outbreak is spreading fast, with the
country recording an average of 461 new cases every 24 hours over the
past 7 days.

The rapid spread of the disease and the increasing number of reported
cases suggest that the outbreak may be one of the worst in the
country's recent history. Densely populated areas of Lusaka with
limited or no access to clean water and sanitation services and poor
hygiene practices are facing a higher incidence of cholera.

"The current cholera outbreak requires concerted and collaborative
efforts to protect the health and well-being of citizens. Our priority
is to work closely with the government, local health authorities, and
cooperating partners to provide immediate support and expertise," says
Dr Nathan Bakyaita, WHO representative in Zambia. "The epidemiological
situation underscores the urgency for a comprehensive response,
addressing the root causes and implementing targeted interventions."

WHO is working with the government to strengthen the key outbreak
response areas. The organization has deployed 23 experts from its
Regional Office for Africa to support emergency coordination, case
management, surveillance, and infection prevention and control, and to
bolster water, sanitation, and hygiene services as well as to increase
public awareness on the risks of the disease.

WHO has also provided more than 14 tons of cholera kits and additional
medical supplies to the government. The supplies are enough to treat
about 3000 mild to severe cases of cholera, including moderate cases
at oral rehydration points in communities. The organization is also
procuring additional supplies and equipment, including cholera beds,
which are set to be delivered in the coming days.

The government has activated high-level outbreak response coordinated
by the Disaster Management and Mitigation Unit. Other efforts to
control the outbreak include the provision of water tanks to supply
communities with clean drinking water, setting up of oral rehydration
points in strategic community places such as markets, churches, and
bus stops for access to early treatment, and public health campaigns
to promote hygiene practices. Cholera treatment centres have been set
up to provide medical care for severe cases, with the largest
treatment centre at the National Heroes Stadium in central Lusaka.

Cholera is an acute, extremely virulent infection that can spread
rapidly and dehydration resulting in high morbidity and mortality.
However, the disease is easily treatable. Most people can be treated
successfully through prompt administration of oral rehydration
solution or intravenous fluids.

Effective control relies on implementing comprehensive measures
including enhanced epidemiological and laboratory surveillance to
detect, confirm, and quickly respond to outbreaks; improving access to
treatment, vaccines, safe water, and basic sanitation; as well as
effecting behavioural change and better hygiene practices among
communities.

[Zambia faces a severe and rapidly escalating cholera outbreak, with
Lusaka, Central, and Eastern provinces bearing the brunt of the
impact. The reported cases and fatalities underscore the urgency for
immediate and comprehensive response measures. The ongoing vaccination
campaign, supported by international organizations like WHO, Gavi, and
UNICEF, is a crucial step in curbing the spread of the disease,
particularly in densely populated areas lacking adequate water,
sanitation, and hygiene practices. To strengthen the response,
continued collaboration between the government, health authorities,
and partners is essential. - Mod.TU

The Sudanese Ministry of Health has confirmed the presence of a
cholera outbreak in the River Nile State, with 36 suspected cases and
2 deaths reported. The outbreak, which initially emerged in Gedaref
and Khartoum states in September 2023, has since spread to several
other states, including Al-Jazirah, White Nile, Red Sea, and Kassala.
The United Nations has warned that the disease could affect over 3
million Sudanese.

Federal Minister of Health Haitham Mohamed Ibrahim met with health
officials in the River Nile State on Friday [19 Jan 2024] and
confirmed that cases had been detected in 3 localities, with the
majority in Al-Damer locality in the Sidon region. The Minister
directed the activation of therapeutic protocols in cholera treatment
centres and acknowledged the health risks posed by mining activities
and the large influx of displaced people and migrants in the state. He
emphasized the need for preparedness and increased health
interventions and called for regular environmental sanitation
campaigns across all localities. The Minister reassured the stability
of the state's pharmaceutical supply of intravenous solutions and
medications and reiterated his commitment to providing support to
healthcare systems to combat the epidemic and safeguard public health
across Sudan.

Minister Ibrahim stressed the importance of concerted efforts to
implement and support health activities, intensify awareness and
education about epidemic diseases, and recognize the crucial role of
environmental health management in mitigating the spread of cholera.
He emphasized the need for individuals to follow preventive measures,
such as covering eating utensils, washing hands thoroughly, reporting
suspected cases, and avoiding the consumption of untreated water.

In December 2023, the Sudanese Ministry of Health launched a 2nd
vaccination campaign against cholera in Khartoum State, targeting the
localities of Karari, Umm Badda, and East Nile. The 1st campaign,
conducted in November 2023, covered Gedaref and Gezira states, with
approximately 2.2 million doses of vaccines provided by the Global
Mechanism for the Elimination of Cholera.

[The spread of the outbreak to various African countries indicates a
major challenge to contain and manage the epidemic. The sporadic
outbreaks associated with multilayer factors including environmental
issues have been occurring in more than 13 countries since 2023. To
effectively respond to these outbreaks of cholera, it is crucial to
prioritize continued environmental sanitation campaigns, intensify
awareness and education initiatives, and ensure the availability and
accessibility of vaccinations across affected regions. Additionally,
collaborative efforts between local and international health agencies,
ongoing surveillance, and the enforcement of preventive measures at
the community level are vital components of a robust response
strategy. The commitment to pharmaceutical supply stability and
support for healthcare systems is reassuring, and sustained efforts in
these areas will be key to safeguarding public health. - Mod.TU

-outbreak?lang=3Den</a>=0D<br>=0D<br>=0D<br>As the cholera outbreak in Zamb=
ia continues to expand rapidly, efforts<br>are being stepped up to halt the=
 spread of disease and save lives. A<br>vaccination campaign is currently u=
nderway targeting 1.5 million<br>people, including children, health workers=
, and people at high risk of<br>infection in the worst affected areas.=0D<b=
r>=0D<br>In partnership with Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, UNICEF, and others=
,<br>World Health Organization (WHO) is supporting the government to<br>eff=
ectively roll out the oral cholera vaccination campaign as well as<br>bolst=
er ongoing outbreak control measures. More than 1.4 million<br>cholera vacc=
ine doses have been delivered to the country to help stem<br>the outbreak, =
with another 200 000 additional doses for a total of<br>around 1.7 million =
doses approved by the WHO International<br>Coordinating Group on Vaccine Pr=
ovision.=0D<br>=0D<br>The government declared a new outbreak in October 202=
3, which began in<br>Lusaka province. As of 18 Jan 2024, 10 887 cases and 4=
32 deaths were<br>reported across 9 of the country's 10 provinces. Lusaka, =
Central, and<br>Eastern provinces are the worst affected. Lusaka district i=
s the<br>epicentre of the outbreak. The outbreak is spreading fast, with th=
e<br>country recording an average of 461 new cases every 24 hours over the<=
br>past 7 days.=0D<br>=0D<br>The rapid spread of the disease and the increa=
sing number of reported<br>cases suggest that the outbreak may be one of th=
e worst in the<br>country's recent history. Densely populated areas of Lusa=
ka with<br>limited or no access to clean water and sanitation services and =
poor<br>hygiene practices are facing a higher incidence of cholera.=0D<br>=0D=
<br>"The current cholera outbreak requires concerted and collaborative<br>e=
fforts to protect the health and well-being of citizens. Our priority<br>is=
 to work closely with the government, local health authorities, and<br>coop=
erating partners to provide immediate support and expertise," says<br>Dr Na=
than Bakyaita, WHO representative in Zambia. "The epidemiological<br>situat=
ion underscores the urgency for a comprehensive response,<br>addressing the=
 root causes and implementing targeted interventions."=0D<br>=0D<br>WHO is =
working with the government to strengthen the key outbreak<br>response area=
s. The organization has deployed 23 experts from its<br>Regional Office for=
 Africa to support emergency coordination, case<br>management, surveillance=
, and infection prevention and control, and to<br>bolster water, sanitation=
, and hygiene services as well as to increase<br>public awareness on the ri=
sks of the disease.=0D<br>=0D<br>WHO has also provided more than 14 tons of=
 cholera kits and additional<br>medical supplies to the government. The sup=
plies are enough to treat<br>about 3000 mild to severe cases of cholera, in=
cluding moderate cases<br>at oral rehydration points in communities. The or=
ganization is also<br>procuring additional supplies and equipment, includin=
g cholera beds,<br>which are set to be delivered in the coming days.=0D<br>=0D=
<br>The government has activated high-level outbreak response coordinated<b=
r>by the Disaster Management and Mitigation Unit. Other efforts to<br>contr=
ol the outbreak include the provision of water tanks to supply<br>communiti=
es with clean drinking water, setting up of oral rehydration<br>points in s=
trategic community places such as markets, churches, and<br>bus stops for a=
ccess to early treatment, and public health campaigns<br>to promote hygiene=
 practices. Cholera treatment centres have been set<br>up to provide medica=
l care for severe cases, with the largest<br>treatment centre at the Nation=
al Heroes Stadium in central Lusaka.=0D<br>=0D<br>Cholera is an acute, extr=
emely virulent infection that can spread<br>rapidly and dehydration resulti=
ng in high morbidity and mortality.<br>However, the disease is easily treat=
able. Most people can be treated<br>successfully through prompt administrat=
ion of oral rehydration<br>solution or intravenous fluids.=0D<br>=0D<br>Eff=
ective control relies on implementing comprehensive measures<br>including e=
nhanced epidemiological and laboratory surveillance to<br>detect, confirm, =
and quickly respond to outbreaks; improving access to<br>treatment, vaccine=
s, safe water, and basic sanitation; as well as<br>effecting behavioural ch=
ange and better hygiene practices among<br>communities.=0D<br>=0D<br>--=0D<=

Zambia faces a severe and rapidly escalating cholera outbreak, with<br>Lusa=

River Nile State, with 36 suspected cases and<br>2 deaths reported. The out=
break, which initially emerged in Gedaref<br>and Khartoum states in Septemb=
er 2023, has since spread to several<br>other states, including Al-Jazirah,=
 White Nile, Red Sea, and Kassala.<br>The United Nations has warned that th=
e disease could affect over 3<br>million Sudanese.=0D<br>=0D<br>Federal Min=
ister of Health Haitham Mohamed Ibrahim met with health<br>officials in the=
 River Nile State on Friday [19 Jan 2024] and<br>confirmed that cases had b=
een detected in 3 localities, with the<br>majority in Al-Damer locality in =
the Sidon region. The Minister<br>directed the activation of therapeutic pr=
otocols in cholera treatment<br>centres and acknowledged the health risks p=
osed by mining activities<br>and the large influx of displaced people and m=
igrants in the state. He<br>emphasized the need for preparedness and increa=
sed health<br>interventions and called for regular environmental sanitation=
<br>campaigns across all localities. The Minister reassured the stability<b=
r>of the state's pharmaceutical supply of intravenous solutions and<br>medi=
cations and reiterated his commitment to providing support to<br>healthcare=
 systems to combat the epidemic and safeguard public health<br>across Sudan=
.=0D<br>=0D<br>Minister Ibrahim stressed the importance of concerted effort=
s to<br>implement and support health activities, intensify awareness and<br=
>education about epidemic diseases, and recognize the crucial role of<br>en=
vironmental health management in mitigating the spread of cholera.<br>He em=
phasized the need for individuals to follow preventive measures,<br>such as=
 covering eating utensils, washing hands thoroughly, reporting<br>suspected=
 cases, and avoiding the consumption of untreated water.=0D<br>=0D<br>In De=
cember 2023, the Sudanese Ministry of Health launched a 2nd<br>vaccination =
campaign against cholera in Khartoum State, targeting the<br>localities of =
Karari, Umm Badda, and East Nile. The 1st campaign,<br>conducted in Novembe=
r 2023, covered Gedaref and Gezira states, with<br>approximately 2.2 millio=
n doses of vaccines provided by the Global<br>Mechanism for the Elimination=
 of Cholera.=0D<br>=0D<br>--=0D<br>Communicated by:=0D<br>ProMED=0D<br>via=0D=
<br>ProMED-EAFR<br><br>[The spread of the outbreak to various African count=
ries indicates a<br>major challenge to contain and manage the epidemic. The=
 sporadic<br>outbreaks associated with multilayer factors including environ=
mental<br>issues have been occurring in more than 13 countries since 2023. =
To<br>effectively respond to these outbreaks of cholera, it is crucial to<b=
r>prioritize continued environmental sanitation campaigns, intensify<br>awa=
reness and education initiatives, and ensure the availability and<br>access=
ibility of vaccinations across affected regions. Additionally,<br>collabora=
tive efforts between local and international health agencies,<br>ongoing su=
