Traditional dish behind Welsh _Salmonella_ outbreak
---------------------------------------------------
Contaminated lamb meat caused a salmonellosis outbreak in a minority
ethnic community in Wales, according to researchers. In July 2021,
Public Health Wales received 2 notifications of _Salmonella_. Both
patients had attended a barbecue in a park in Cardiff to celebrate Eid
al-Adha, 2 days earlier. Other cases related to the barbecue were
found and an outbreak investigation was started. The barbecue was
attended by members of the North African community. On the same day,
smaller lunches were held in 3 homes. Many people went to both a lunch
and the barbecue.

A traditional dish containing raw liver called marara, served at the
barbecue, was the likely vehicle for infection. Marara is made from
raw liver, usually cut into strips, washed in lemon juice and vinegar,
and marinated in herbs, spices, and peanut butter. Meat and offal came
from 2 local butchers with the same supplier and samples had identical
whole genome sequences as cases. In total, 22 cases were identified in
the outbreak, of which 5 were confirmed and 17 were probable
_Salmonella_ Typhimurium cases, according to the study published in
the journal Epidemiology and Infection. Five people developed symptoms
in the 8 days following the barbecue, which suggests person-to-person
transmission since some of them had attended the barbecue but did not
become unwell until after the incubation period for salmonellosis.

Many cases were severely unwell, with 12 seeking emergency hospital
care and 6 being admitted overnight. One patient needed treatment in
an intensive care unit. One respondent noted gastrointestinal sickness
in a barbecue attendee and resident in their household, with symptoms
starting before the barbecue. The barbecue food was prepared at home
by 8 people. It was transported, not chilled, to consume at the
evening barbecue, and included marinated uncooked lamb, several side
dishes, and a number of traditional dishes.

The religious practice involving animal slaughter for Eid al-Adha is
called Qurbani. The day of the barbecue was very hot, plus the raw
liver and lamb was left unchilled for a long period. Questionnaire
responses indicated that some lamb cooked on the barbecue was pink
inside and that marinade from the raw liver was used as a dip for
other food. One person used the plate the raw liver was served on to
eat their meal. All of this offers multiple opportunities for
cross-contamination, said scientists.

Sequences from 11 samples of leftover raw lamb were genetically
indistinguishable from one another, and from those in the 5 human
isolates from barbecue attendees.

Three people had more than one pathogen in their stool sample
including 2 co-infections with enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ (EHEC) and
one with _Campylobacter_. Identical _E. coli_ sequences to those in
patients were found from samples taken from the butchers and supplying
abattoir.

Microbiological evidence suggests there was widespread contamination
of sheep meat consumed at the barbecue, and that cross-contamination
with other dishes occurred. However, it was not possible to establish
where contamination occurred in the food chain.
The 5 sequenced cases are part of a larger ongoing cluster with cases
since 2018. They are spread across Wales, Scotland, London, and the
South West and Midlands of England. At least 2 cases in the wider
cluster were people with occupational contact with sheep farms,
suggesting a possible transmission chain with a farm origin.
Investigations are ongoing to find the source.

An educational session was held during the Eid al-Adha festival which
included members of the community that eat the traditional marara dish
and others that celebrate Eid al-Adha. Key food safety and hygiene
messages were presented followed by a conversation. The session
received positive feedback from participants. A communication
campaign, noting different cultural practices, was developed with the
affected community.

"Future outbreak investigations should be relevant to the community
affected by considering dishes beyond those found in routine
questionnaires," said scientists.

This outbreak involves undercooked and raw meat, underscoring the need
for adequate cooking temperatures as well as cross-contamination due
to poor kitchen hygiene. Additionally, other pathogens occurred as
well as the _S._ Typhimurium.

Interestingly, there is a Marara (or Marrara) syndrome related to the
dish (Yagi H, el Bahari S, Mohamed HA, et al. The Marrara syndrome: a

allergic reactions to the immature forms of the tongue worm.

"Abstract
---------
The Marrara syndrome, like Halazoun in Lebanon, is a hypersensitivity
reaction of the upper respiratory tract and buccopharyngeal mucosa to
nymphs of _Linguatula serrata_. The condition follows the consumption
of Marrara which consists of raw liver, lungs, trachea and rumen of
goats and sheep infected with larvae of _L. serrata_. The adult worm
is found in the nasal passages of dogs. Sheep and goats are infected
by eggs from infected dogs. A survey that included 240 adult
individuals in a village of endemic _L. serrata_ infection in the
Sudan showed that 20% experienced symptoms of allergic nasopharyngitis
(Marrara syndrome) following the consumption of raw viscera of goats
or sheep at least once in their life. In a prospective study of 24
patients who reported to hospital with the Marrara syndrome, the
clinical features included itching in the throat and nose, unilateral
conductive deafness, tinnitus and facial palsy. Secondary bacterial
infection caused suppurative otitis media. Adult _L. serrata_
parasites were found in the nasal passages of 56 and 47% of male and
female dogs in the endemic area. Nymphs were recovered from the
mesenteric lymph nodes, lungs and livers of goats in the area."

<br>Traditional dish behind Welsh _Salmonella_ outbreak=0D<br>-------------=
--------------------------------------=0D<br>Contaminated lamb meat caused =
a salmonellosis outbreak in a minority<br>ethnic community in Wales, accord=
ing to researchers. In July 2021,<br>Public Health Wales received 2 notific=
ations of _Salmonella_. Both<br>patients had attended a barbecue in a park =
in Cardiff to celebrate Eid<br>al-Adha, 2 days earlier. Other cases related=
 to the barbecue were<br>found and an outbreak investigation was started. T=
he barbecue was<br>attended by members of the North African community. On t=
he same day,<br>smaller lunches were held in 3 homes. Many people went to b=
oth a lunch<br>and the barbecue.=0D<br>=0D<br>A traditional dish containing=
 raw liver called marara, served at the<br>barbecue, was the likely vehicle=
 for infection. Marara is made from<br>raw liver, usually cut into strips, =
washed in lemon juice and vinegar,<br>and marinated in herbs, spices, and p=
eanut butter. Meat and offal came<br>from 2 local butchers with the same su=
pplier and samples had identical<br>whole genome sequences as cases. In tot=
al, 22 cases were identified in<br>the outbreak, of which 5 were confirmed =
and 17 were probable<br>_Salmonella_ Typhimurium cases, according to the st=
udy published in<br>the journal Epidemiology and Infection. Five people dev=
eloped symptoms<br>in the 8 days following the barbecue, which suggests per=
son-to-person<br>transmission since some of them had attended the barbecue =
but did not<br>become unwell until after the incubation period for salmonel=
losis.=0D<br>=0D<br>Many cases were severely unwell, with 12 seeking emerge=
ncy hospital<br>care and 6 being admitted overnight. One patient needed tre=
atment in<br>an intensive care unit. One respondent noted gastrointestinal =
sickness<br>in a barbecue attendee and resident in their household, with sy=
mptoms<br>starting before the barbecue. The barbecue food was prepared at h=
ome<br>by 8 people. It was transported, not chilled, to consume at the<br>e=
vening barbecue, and included marinated uncooked lamb, several side<br>dish=
es, and a number of traditional dishes.=0D<br>=0D<br>The religious practice=
 involving animal slaughter for Eid al-Adha is<br>called Qurbani. The day o=
f the barbecue was very hot, plus the raw<br>liver and lamb was left unchil=
led for a long period. Questionnaire<br>responses indicated that some lamb =
cooked on the barbecue was pink<br>inside and that marinade from the raw li=
ver was used as a dip for<br>other food. One person used the plate the raw =
liver was served on to<br>eat their meal. All of this offers multiple oppor=
tunities for<br>cross-contamination, said scientists.=0D<br>=0D<br>Sequence=
s from 11 samples of leftover raw lamb were genetically<br>indistinguishabl=
e from one another, and from those in the 5 human<br>isolates from barbecue=
 attendees.=0D<br>=0D<br>Three people had more than one pathogen in their s=
tool sample<br>including 2 co-infections with enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ (=
EHEC) and<br>one with _Campylobacter_. Identical _E. coli_ sequences to tho=
se in<br>patients were found from samples taken from the butchers and suppl=
ying<br>abattoir.=0D<br>=0D<br>Microbiological evidence suggests there was =
widespread contamination<br>of sheep meat consumed at the barbecue, and tha=
t cross-contamination<br>with other dishes occurred. However, it was not po=
ssible to establish<br>where contamination occurred in the food chain.=0D<b=
r>The 5 sequenced cases are part of a larger ongoing cluster with cases<br>=
since 2018. They are spread across Wales, Scotland, London, and the<br>Sout=
h West and Midlands of England. At least 2 cases in the wider<br>cluster we=
re people with occupational contact with sheep farms,<br>suggesting a possi=
ble transmission chain with a farm origin.<br>Investigations are ongoing to=
 find the source.=0D<br>=0D<br>An educational session was held during the E=
id al-Adha festival which<br>included members of the community that eat the=
 traditional marara dish<br>and others that celebrate Eid al-Adha. Key food=
 safety and hygiene<br>messages were presented followed by a conversation. =
The session<br>received positive feedback from participants. A communicatio=
n<br>campaign, noting different cultural practices, was developed with the<=
br>affected community.=0D<br>=0D<br>"Future outbreak investigations should =
be relevant to the community<br>affected by considering dishes beyond those=
 found in routine<br>questionnaires," said scientists.=0D<br>=0D<br>--=0D<b=

>The Marrara syndrome, like Halazoun in Lebanon, is a hypersensitivity<br>r=

rrara which consists of raw liver, lungs, trachea and rumen of<br>goats and=
 sheep infected with larvae of _L. serrata_. The adult worm<br>is found in =
the nasal passages of dogs. Sheep and goats are infected<br>by eggs from in=
fected dogs. A survey that included 240 adult<br>individuals in a village o=
f endemic _L. serrata_ infection in the<br>Sudan showed that 20% experience=
d symptoms of allergic nasopharyngitis<br>(Marrara syndrome) following the =
consumption of raw viscera of goats<br>or sheep at least once in their life=
. In a prospective study of 24<br>patients who reported to hospital with th=
e Marrara syndrome, the<br>clinical features included itching in the throat=
 and nose, unilateral<br>conductive deafness, tinnitus and facial palsy. Se=
condary bacterial<br>infection caused suppurative otitis media. Adult _L. s=
errata_<br>parasites were found in the nasal passages of 56 and 47% of male=
 and<br>female dogs in the endemic area. Nymphs were recovered from the<br>=
mesenteric lymph nodes, lungs and livers of goats in the area."=0D<br>- Mod=
