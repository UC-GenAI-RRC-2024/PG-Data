Investigation and Results
-------------------------
On 7 Mar 2023, the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention
(Maine CDC) received a report from a group of hotel guests who had
developed ear pain, rashes, and eye irritation after using a swimming
pool at hotel A during the 4-5 Mar 2023 weekend. Later that day, an
additional family that had used hotel A's swimming pool the same
weekend reported experiencing similar illness, in addition to redness
and pain of their hands and feet. Over the next 2 days, 4 additional
groups of guests reported similar illnesses after using the hotel A
pool during the same weekend. On 7 Mar 2023, in response to the
reports, Maine CDC's Health Inspection Program contacted hotel A and
learned that management had voluntarily closed the pool after
receiving guest complaints. In response, on 8 Mar 2023, Maine CDC
initiated an epidemiologic, laboratory, and environmental health
investigation.

Case Identification: Maine CDC used illness reports to identify 6
households with members who had visited hotel A's pool during the
weekend of 4-5 Mar 2023 and interviewed a representative from each
household using a standard questionnaire. Interviewers asked about
other groups or persons who had used the hotel pool; additional
identified persons were also contacted and interviewed. Guests were
asked about their use of the hotel A pool, other pools, and hot tubs
since 24 Feb 2023, and subsequent illness.

A total of 10 households (30 guests) were identified as having visited
or used the hotel A pool during 4-5 Mar 2023 (Figure 1 [for
Figures/Tables, see source URL above - Mod.LL]); 1 person per
household was interviewed about all household members who used the
pool. To further assess the scope of the outbreak, Maine CDC obtained
a list of registered guests who were at hotel A during 1-7 Mar 2023
and identified 29 additional registrants who might have been present
at hotel A during 4-5 Mar 2023. These additional registrants were sent
the standardized questionnaire by text or email and asked to fill out
a separate questionnaire for each household member who used the pool.
Questionnaires were completed for 5 additional guests.

A total of 15 interviews or questionnaires were completed for 35
unique persons. Maine CDC requested that symptomatic guests ask their
healthcare provider to obtain a skin lesion swab for laboratory
analysis and requested that laboratories send any isolates to Maine's
Health and Environmental Testing Laboratory.

A case was defined as the occurrence of ear pain, rash, or pain or
swelling in feet or hands in a person within 7 days after using the
hotel pool during 4-5 Mar 2023. Among 35 persons for whom information
was available, 26 (74%) reportedly used the hotel A swimming pool
during that time period. Among these 26 persons, 23 (88%) experienced
an illness meeting the case definition; illness onset date was
available for 20 persons (Figure 2). Among the 23 patients, 16 (70%)
had ear pain, 15 (65%) had a rash, and 7 (30%) had pain or swelling in
their feet or hands (Table). Fifteen (65%) patients were female. Among
22 patients with available information, age ranged from 5 months to 61
years (median =3D 8 years). Among 20 patients with reported time and
date of illness onset, illness began a median of 24 hours (range =3D 8
hours-6 days) after use of the hotel A pool.

Laboratory Evaluation: Skin lesion swabs were obtained from 3
patients, 2 of whom were family members who lived in separate
households, spent time together outside of the hotel pool, and had no
other pool or hot tub exposures. _P. aeruginosa_ was identified in all
3 specimens; the isolates of the 2 family members were sent to Maine's
Health and Environmental Testing Laboratory for whole genome
sequencing. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis, using
CLC-BIO (version 23.0.2; Qiagen Aarhus), indicated that the 2 isolates
were highly related with a 2-SNP difference, suggesting a common
exposure.

Hotel A Pool Inspections: In January 2022, the hotel pool had failed a
routine health department inspection. During that inspection, several
violations were identified: 1) no operator had successfully completed
approved training, 2) no pool logs documenting free chlorine
concentration readings at least 3 times per day while the pool was
open for use, 3) no posted routine operating procedures, and 4) no
functioning disinfectant feeder installed. During the subsequent 8 Mar
2023 inspection, the health inspector noted that although the hotel
did have an operator who had successfully completed approved training
<2 weeks before inspection, none of the other previously identified
violations had been corrected. The pool logs for 1-5 Mar 2023 showed 2
compliant free chlorine concentration readings, not the expected 15,
and both readings were dated 3 Mar 2023. The inspector also noted that
an indeterminant amount of chlorine had been added to the pool water
by hotel staff members after they voluntarily closed the pool;
therefore, water quality and environmental samples were not
collected.

Because the identified violations included imminent health hazards and
uncorrected previously identified violations, Maine CDC's Health
Inspection Program directed hotel A to not reopen the pool until all
the violations were addressed. The health inspector provided
recommendations to address the violations. On reinspection 1 month
later, the violations were noted to be corrected. No additional hotel
A pool-associated illnesses were identified after reopening.

Discussion
---------
_P. aeruginosa_ can cause acute otitis externa (swimmer's ear),
folliculitis (hot tub rash) (1), and painful nodular lesions on the
soles or palms (hot hand-foot syndrome) (2) and is likely to be
transmitted through contact with contaminated water in pools or hot
tubs and not through person-to-person contact (3). _P. aeruginosa_ is
readily inactivated by disinfectants such as chlorine and bromine.
Because of this, maintaining a minimum free chlorine concentration of
at least 1 ppm in treated recreational water venues open to the public
as recommended by CDC and as required by Maine's pool code, prevents
waterborne transmission of most pathogens, including _P. aeruginosa_.
The lack of an installed and functioning disinfectant feeder in this
pool and inadequate monitoring of the free chlorine concentration
during 1-5 Mar 2023, particularly the 4-5 Mar 2023 weekend, would make
it more challenging to maintain adequate free chlorine concentration,
and thus, more challenging to prevent pathogen transmission.
Inadequately maintained disinfectant concentration can lead to
proliferation of _P. aeruginosa_ and buildup of biofilm on wet venue
surface, scale, and sediment. Biofilm is a primarily polysaccharide
matrix that is produced by microbial cells and in which bacteria are
embedded; biofilm is difficult to remove and cannot be removed by
gentle rinsing (4). Even when adequate disinfectant concentration is
maintained, the extracellular matrix of the biofilm can protect _P.
aeruginosa_ and other pathogens from disinfectants.

Among 987 treated recreational water-associated outbreaks reported to
CDC for the period 1971-2021, 369 (37.4%) were linked to a hotel
setting (i.e., hotel, motel, lodging, inn, or resort) (5). In
addition, for the period 1971-2021, 38 states reported 222 outbreaks
associated with treated recreational water venues that were confirmed
or suspected to be caused by _P. aeruginosa_ (5), 152 (68%) of which
were associated with a hotel setting. A total of 17 (11%) of these 152
outbreaks were associated with pools only and 87 (57%) with hot tubs
only. Among the 152 outbreaks, 100 (66%) began during January-April.
Outbreak exposures often occur during a weekend, when trained
operators might not be on duty, and when events, including parties and
sports tournaments, are scheduled (6).

To help prevent outbreaks caused by _P. aeruginosa_ and other
pathogens readily inactivated by disinfectants, local, state,
territorial, and tribal jurisdictions can voluntarily adopt
recommendations in CDC's Model Aquatic Health Code (MAHC). Such
recommendations include having an operator who has successfully
completed approved training to ensure adequate recreational water
disinfectant concentration (MAHC 5.7.3.1.1 and 5.7.3.1.2) (7,8) and
conducting a daily preopening inspection for biofilm (MAHC 6.4.1.3.1)
and, if needed, removing biofilm by vigorous scrubbing. Public health
officials can also increase awareness of healthy swimming by
disseminating prevention messages, including recommendations to check
the latest inspection score before using the pool. Much like
restaurant inspection scores, scores from inspections of treated
recreational water venues open to the public provide an assessment of
operation and management. These scores are often posted waterside or
on the jurisdiction's website. Because inspections are a snapshot in
time, pool and hot tub users can additionally protect themselves by
conducting their own mini-inspection before getting in the water
(e.g., measuring the disinfectant levels and pH using test strips that
are readily available at hardware and big-box stores); such
interventions should not replace pool and hot tub management but can
provide users a timely assessment of water conditions.

Limitations
-----------
The findings in this report are subject to at least 2 limitations.
First, the reported number of persons who used the hotel pool and
subsequently developed illness meeting the case definition likely
underestimates the actual incidence. For example, although the hotel
identified 29 additional guest registrants who were at the hotel
during the 4-5 Mar 2023 weekend, only 5 completed the questionnaire.
Second, a definitive link between illness and the hotel pool could not
be established. The 2 isolates found to be only 2 SNPs apart were from
family members who both used the hotel pool but also spent time
together outside of the hotel pool. Not collecting environmental
samples precluded molecular characterization of an isolate and
comparison with clinical isolates. However, neither family member
reported other pool or hot tub exposures, and _P. aeruginosa_ is
likely to be transmitted through contaminated water but not person to
person. The hotel pool remains the most likely source of exposure.

Implications for Public Health Practice
---------------------------------------
Enforcement of local, state, territorial, and tribal codes and
dissemination of prevention messaging to pool and hot tub users can
reduce the likelihood of outbreaks caused by _P. aeruginosa_ and other
pathogens. Healthy swimming promotion efforts are especially necessary
when the public might be more likely to stay at hotels and use the
pools and hot tubs. To prevent outbreaks, operators should be vigilant
about proper operation and management, especially during January-April
and weekends.

[This MMWR report is important to remind us about this entity of
mucocutaneous infection with _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ related to
swimming pools and, more commonly, hot tubs when adequate
concentrations of chlorine are not maintained. _Pseudomonas_
folliculitis can be misdiagnosed as hand/foot/mouth syndrome or even
varicella. Indeed, this moderator had a personal experience with this
in our youngest daughter who was first diagnosed with varicella
(despite a past history) until her father (me) obtained the history of
her use of a neighbor's hot tub and cultured a lesion that grew
_Pseudomonas_.

--------=0D<br>=0D<br>Investigation and Results=0D<br>---------------------=
----=0D<br>On 7 Mar 2023, the Maine Center for Disease Control and Preventi=
on<br>(Maine CDC) received a report from a group of hotel guests who had<br=
>developed ear pain, rashes, and eye irritation after using a swimming<br>p=
ool at hotel A during the 4-5 Mar 2023 weekend. Later that day, an<br>addit=
ional family that had used hotel A's swimming pool the same<br>weekend repo=
rted experiencing similar illness, in addition to redness<br>and pain of th=
eir hands and feet. Over the next 2 days, 4 additional<br>groups of guests =
reported similar illnesses after using the hotel A<br>pool during the same =
weekend. On 7 Mar 2023, in response to the<br>reports, Maine CDC's Health I=
nspection Program contacted hotel A and<br>learned that management had volu=
ntarily closed the pool after<br>receiving guest complaints. In response, o=
n 8 Mar 2023, Maine CDC<br>initiated an epidemiologic, laboratory, and envi=
ronmental health<br>investigation.=0D<br>=0D<br>Case Identification: Maine =
CDC used illness reports to identify 6<br>households with members who had v=
isited hotel A's pool during the<br>weekend of 4-5 Mar 2023 and interviewed=
 a representative from each<br>household using a standard questionnaire. In=
terviewers asked about<br>other groups or persons who had used the hotel po=
ol; additional<br>identified persons were also contacted and interviewed. G=
uests were<br>asked about their use of the hotel A pool, other pools, and h=
ot tubs<br>since 24 Feb 2023, and subsequent illness.=0D<br>=0D<br>A total =
of 10 households (30 guests) were identified as having visited<br>or used t=
he hotel A pool during 4-5 Mar 2023 (Figure 1 [for<br>Figures/Tables, see s=
ource URL above - Mod.LL]); 1 person per<br>household was interviewed about=
 all household members who used the<br>pool. To further assess the scope of=
 the outbreak, Maine CDC obtained<br>a list of registered guests who were a=
t hotel A during 1-7 Mar 2023<br>and identified 29 additional registrants w=
ho might have been present<br>at hotel A during 4-5 Mar 2023. These additio=
nal registrants were sent<br>the standardized questionnaire by text or emai=
l and asked to fill out<br>a separate questionnaire for each household memb=
er who used the pool.<br>Questionnaires were completed for 5 additional gue=
sts.=0D<br>=0D<br>A total of 15 interviews or questionnaires were completed=
 for 35<br>unique persons. Maine CDC requested that symptomatic guests ask =
their<br>healthcare provider to obtain a skin lesion swab for laboratory<br=
>analysis and requested that laboratories send any isolates to Maine's<br>H=
ealth and Environmental Testing Laboratory.=0D<br>=0D<br>A case was defined=
 as the occurrence of ear pain, rash, or pain or<br>swelling in feet or han=
ds in a person within 7 days after using the<br>hotel pool during 4-5 Mar 2=
023. Among 35 persons for whom information<br>was available, 26 (74%) repor=
tedly used the hotel A swimming pool<br>during that time period. Among thes=
e 26 persons, 23 (88%) experienced<br>an illness meeting the case definitio=
n; illness onset date was<br>available for 20 persons (Figure 2). Among the=
 23 patients, 16 (70%)<br>had ear pain, 15 (65%) had a rash, and 7 (30%) ha=
d pain or swelling in<br>their feet or hands (Table). Fifteen (65%) patient=
s were female. Among<br>22 patients with available information, age ranged =
from 5 months to 61<br>years (median =3D 8 years). Among 20 patients with r=
eported time and<br>date of illness onset, illness began a median of 24 hou=
rs (range =3D 8<br>hours-6 days) after use of the hotel A pool.=0D<br>=0D<b=
r>Laboratory Evaluation: Skin lesion swabs were obtained from 3<br>patients=
, 2 of whom were family members who lived in separate<br>households, spent =
time together outside of the hotel pool, and had no<br>other pool or hot tu=
b exposures. _P. aeruginosa_ was identified in all<br>3 specimens; the isol=
ates of the 2 family members were sent to Maine's<br>Health and Environment=
al Testing Laboratory for whole genome<br>sequencing. Single nucleotide pol=
ymorphism (SNP) analysis, using<br>CLC-BIO (version 23.0.2; Qiagen Aarhus),=
 indicated that the 2 isolates<br>were highly related with a 2-SNP differen=
ce, suggesting a common<br>exposure.=0D<br>=0D<br>Hotel A Pool Inspections:=
 In January 2022, the hotel pool had failed a<br>routine health department =
inspection. During that inspection, several<br>violations were identified: =
1) no operator had successfully completed<br>approved training, 2) no pool =
logs documenting free chlorine<br>concentration readings at least 3 times p=
er day while the pool was<br>open for use, 3) no posted routine operating p=
rocedures, and 4) no<br>functioning disinfectant feeder installed. During t=
he subsequent 8 Mar<br>2023 inspection, the health inspector noted that alt=
hough the hotel<br>did have an operator who had successfully completed appr=
oved training<br><2 weeks before inspection, none of the other previously i=
dentified<br>violations had been corrected. The pool logs for 1-5 Mar 2023 =
showed 2<br>compliant free chlorine concentration readings, not the expecte=
d 15,<br>and both readings were dated 3 Mar 2023. The inspector also noted =
that<br>an indeterminant amount of chlorine had been added to the pool wate=
r<br>by hotel staff members after they voluntarily closed the pool;<br>ther=
efore, water quality and environmental samples were not<br>collected.=0D<br=
>=0D<br>Because the identified violations included imminent health hazards =
and<br>uncorrected previously identified violations, Maine CDC's Health<br>=
Inspection Program directed hotel A to not reopen the pool until all<br>the=
 violations were addressed. The health inspector provided<br>recommendation=
s to address the violations. On reinspection 1 month<br>later, the violatio=
ns were noted to be corrected. No additional hotel<br>A pool-associated ill=
nesses were identified after reopening.=0D<br>=0D<br>Discussion=0D<br>-----=
----=0D<br>_P. aeruginosa_ can cause acute otitis externa (swimmer's ear),<=
br>folliculitis (hot tub rash) (1), and painful nodular lesions on the<br>s=
oles or palms (hot hand-foot syndrome) (2) and is likely to be<br>transmitt=
ed through contact with contaminated water in pools or hot<br>tubs and not =
through person-to-person contact (3). _P. aeruginosa_ is<br>readily inactiv=
ated by disinfectants such as chlorine and bromine.<br>Because of this, mai=
ntaining a minimum free chlorine concentration of<br>at least 1 ppm in trea=
ted recreational water venues open to the public<br>as recommended by CDC a=
nd as required by Maine's pool code, prevents<br>waterborne transmission of=
 most pathogens, including _P. aeruginosa_.<br>The lack of an installed and=
 functioning disinfectant feeder in this<br>pool and inadequate monitoring =
of the free chlorine concentration<br>during 1-5 Mar 2023, particularly the=
 4-5 Mar 2023 weekend, would make<br>it more challenging to maintain adequa=
te free chlorine concentration,<br>and thus, more challenging to prevent pa=
thogen transmission.<br>Inadequately maintained disinfectant concentration =
can lead to<br>proliferation of _P. aeruginosa_ and buildup of biofilm on w=
et venue<br>surface, scale, and sediment. Biofilm is a primarily polysaccha=
ride<br>matrix that is produced by microbial cells and in which bacteria ar=
e<br>embedded; biofilm is difficult to remove and cannot be removed by<br>g=
entle rinsing (4). Even when adequate disinfectant concentration is<br>main=
tained, the extracellular matrix of the biofilm can protect _P.<br>aerugino=
sa_ and other pathogens from disinfectants.=0D<br>=0D<br>Among 987 treated =
recreational water-associated outbreaks reported to<br>CDC for the period 1=
971-2021, 369 (37.4%) were linked to a hotel<br>setting (i.e., hotel, motel=
, lodging, inn, or resort) (5). In<br>addition, for the period 1971-2021, 3=
8 states reported 222 outbreaks<br>associated with treated recreational wat=
er venues that were confirmed<br>or suspected to be caused by _P. aeruginos=
a_ (5), 152 (68%) of which<br>were associated with a hotel setting. A total=
 of 17 (11%) of these 152<br>outbreaks were associated with pools only and =
87 (57%) with hot tubs<br>only. Among the 152 outbreaks, 100 (66%) began du=
ring January-April.<br>Outbreak exposures often occur during a weekend, whe=
n trained<br>operators might not be on duty, and when events, including par=
ties and<br>sports tournaments, are scheduled (6).=0D<br>=0D<br>To help pre=
vent outbreaks caused by _P. aeruginosa_ and other<br>pathogens readily ina=
ctivated by disinfectants, local, state,<br>territorial, and tribal jurisdi=
ctions can voluntarily adopt<br>recommendations in CDC's Model Aquatic Heal=
th Code (MAHC). Such<br>recommendations include having an operator who has =
successfully<br>completed approved training to ensure adequate recreational=
 water<br>disinfectant concentration (MAHC 5.7.3.1.1 and 5.7.3.1.2) (7,8) a=
nd<br>conducting a daily preopening inspection for biofilm (MAHC 6.4.1.3.1)=
<br>and, if needed, removing biofilm by vigorous scrubbing. Public health<b=
r>officials can also increase awareness of healthy swimming by<br>dissemina=
ting prevention messages, including recommendations to check<br>the latest =
inspection score before using the pool. Much like<br>restaurant inspection =
scores, scores from inspections of treated<br>recreational water venues ope=
n to the public provide an assessment of<br>operation and management. These=
 scores are often posted waterside or<br>on the jurisdiction's website. Bec=
ause inspections are a snapshot in<br>time, pool and hot tub users can addi=
tionally protect themselves by<br>conducting their own mini-inspection befo=
re getting in the water<br>(e.g., measuring the disinfectant levels and pH =
using test strips that<br>are readily available at hardware and big-box sto=
res); such<br>interventions should not replace pool and hot tub management =
but can<br>provide users a timely assessment of water conditions.=0D<br>=0D=
<br>Limitations=0D<br>-----------=0D<br>The findings in this report are sub=
ject to at least 2 limitations.<br>First, the reported number of persons wh=
o used the hotel pool and<br>subsequently developed illness meeting the cas=
e definition likely<br>underestimates the actual incidence. For example, al=
though the hotel<br>identified 29 additional guest registrants who were at =
the hotel<br>during the 4-5 Mar 2023 weekend, only 5 completed the question=
naire.<br>Second, a definitive link between illness and the hotel pool coul=
d not<br>be established. The 2 isolates found to be only 2 SNPs apart were =
from<br>family members who both used the hotel pool but also spent time<br>=
together outside of the hotel pool. Not collecting environmental<br>samples=
 precluded molecular characterization of an isolate and<br>comparison with =
clinical isolates. However, neither family member<br>reported other pool or=
 hot tub exposures, and _P. aeruginosa_ is<br>likely to be transmitted thro=
ugh contaminated water but not person to<br>person. The hotel pool remains =
the most likely source of exposure.=0D<br>=0D<br>Implications for Public He=
alth Practice=0D<br>---------------------------------------=0D<br>Enforceme=
nt of local, state, territorial, and tribal codes and<br>dissemination of p=
revention messaging to pool and hot tub users can<br>reduce the likelihood =
of outbreaks caused by _P. aeruginosa_ and other<br>pathogens. Healthy swim=
ming promotion efforts are especially necessary<br>when the public might be=
 more likely to stay at hotels and use the<br>pools and hot tubs. To preven=
t outbreaks, operators should be vigilant<br>about proper operation and man=
agement, especially during January-April<br>and weekends.=0D<br>=0D<br>Refe=
