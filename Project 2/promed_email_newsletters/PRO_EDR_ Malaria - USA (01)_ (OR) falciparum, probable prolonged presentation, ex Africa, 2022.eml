with Sickle Cell Trait 11 Years after Exposure, Oregon, USA. Emerg

---------------------------------------------------------------------------=
-----
_Plasmodium falciparum_ malaria is a major cause of illness and death
worldwide (1). In disease-hyperendemic areas, most of the population
are parasitemic (2). Chronic exposure results in partial immunity, and
sickle cell trait reduces the severity of infection (3,4). Delayed _P.
falciparum_ malaria after immigration to nonendemic countries has been
reported in the literature, and pregnancy is the most common risk
factor for this unusual presentation (5).

Former residents of disease-endemic areas who have _P. falciparum_
malaria without recent travel risk present a public health challenge
because locally acquired mosquito-borne transmission of the parasite
must be ruled out, given the widespread distribution of _Anopheles_
spp. mosquito vectors in the United States (6-8). We report the
clinical and public health investigation of a case of delayed _P.
falciparum_ malaria in a pregnant woman 11 years after immigration to
the USA from sub-Saharan Africa.

The Study
---------
The patient was a 20-30-year-old multiparous pregnant woman from
sub-Saharan Africa who came to an emergency department at Providence
Portland Medical Center, Portland, Oregon, USA, during her 3rd
trimester; she had inadequate prenatal care and a 2-week history of
loose stools and abdominal pain before defecation. She reported chills
and night sweats without fevers. She denied nausea, vomiting,
epigastric pain, runny nose, cough, sore throat, lymphadenopathy,
dysuria, or vaginal discharge. The patient was tachycardic; fetal
heart rate (FHR) tracing showed a normal FHR, moderate variability,
accelerations, and late and variable decelerations. Initial laboratory
evaluation on the woman showed microcytic anemia, leukocytopenia,
thrombocytopenia, and an increased level of bilirubin (Table [for
Table and Figures, see original URL - Mod.LL]).

Testing results were negative for HIV, SARS-CoV-2, influenza,
hepatitis B, hepatitis C, rubella, and syphilis. The result of a rapid
point-of-care BinaxNOW malaria test (Abbott Laboratories,
<https://www.globalpointofcare.abbott>) was positive for _P.
falciparum_. Thick and thin malaria blood smears showed _P.
falciparum_ (Figure 1). Initial parasitemia was 0.2%. We submitted
blood smears to the Division of Parasitic Diseases and Malaria
diagnostic laboratory, Center for Global Health, Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, and _P. falciparum_ morphologic identification
was confirmed. A pretreatment blood sample was not available for
molecular speciation or whole-genome sequencing.

We initiated a 3-day course of artemether/lumefantrine, and percentage
parasitemia decreased to 0.1% within 24 hours. No parasites were
observed by day 3 of therapy. The patient received intravenous fluids
and 1 unit of packed red blood cells. Maternal tachycardia resolved,
and FHR tracing displayed normal FHR with moderate variability,
accelerations, and resolution of decelerations. The patient's anemia
and thrombocytopenia improved, and her leukocyte count normalized. The
patient gave birth to a healthy post-term infant without evidence of
placental insufficiency. Placental pathologic analysis showed sickled
maternal erythrocytes, pigment in perivillous fibrin, and mild
lymphocytic deciduitis without immunohistochemical evidence of
parasites.

The patient immigrated to the USA with her family 11 years before she
sought care. She had lived in a metropolitan area of Oregon during the
5 years before she sought care and denied any history of foreign or
domestic travel. The patient reported a history of malaria during
childhood 19 years earlier, for which treatment was received while
living in sub-Saharan Africa. She denied any history of blood
transfusions or recent insect bites. The most recent visit to the
patient's home by a person from sub-Saharan Africa occurred 2 years
before her illness. She had a history of anemia during previous
pregnancies, and her 1st pregnancy was complicated by thrombocytopenia
and preeclampsia. She had a history of sickle cell trait diagnosed by
hemoglobin fractionation.

We explored the plausibility of local malaria transmission by
evaluating current mosquito surveillance data and conducting case
finding with temporospatial proximity to the case. The investigation
was anchored to month of symptom onset (September 2022). We used
mapping to visualize spatial associations between mosquito
surveillance, malaria case reports, syndromic surveillance, and death
surveillance (Figure 2).

_Anopheles freeborni_ and _An. punctipennis_ mosquitoes were
identified during Washington County Public Health's 2022 Mosquito
Control trapping season, May-September 2022. However, during the
period of our investigation, temperatures had decreased, and
_Anopheles_ mosquitos were not active in the area. _P. falciparum_
case finding within the statewide reportable disease database showed 1
travel-associated malaria case with an onset 2 months before this
patient and about 4 miles [6.4 km] away. There was no epidemiologic
link between the cases; whole blood was not available to identify
microsatellite parasite signatures. A search of Oregon's Electronic
Surveillance System for the Early Notification of Community-Based
Epidemics for emergency department encounters with a discharge
diagnosis of fever of unknown origin (FUO) showed greater than
expected activity in the week of the patient's onset of symptoms (9).
However, the trend was not isolated to the proximity of the
case-patient, and many encounters noted manifestations consistent with
viral infections.

An Early Notification of Community-Based Epidemics query for mosquito
bites and arboviral diseases did not show greater than expected
activity. A vital records query for deaths with an associated
diagnosis of FUO showed 1 death temporospatially related to the case.
Medical record review by the Malaria Branch, Center for Global Health,
Division of Parasitic Diseases and Malaria, Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, ruled out the death as related to malaria due
to clinical and laboratory incompatibility. Thus, there was no
evidence to support local mosquito-borne transmission.

Conclusions
-----------
We report a case of _P. falciparum_ malaria in a pregnant woman 11
years after immigration from sub-Saharan Africa to the USA. To assess
for local mosquito-borne transmission, a joint state and local public
health investigation examined mosquito surveillance data, performed
case finding for additional malaria cases, and reviewed syndromic
surveillance and death surveillance for FUO diagnoses with
temporospatial proximity to the case. This comprehensive assessment
enabled the public health departments to effectively evaluate local
mosquito-borne transmission and emerging local risk.

Although delayed _P. falciparum_ illness has been documented, it
remains rare, and the patient's latency period was unusually long at
11 years. In 1 case series and literature review, pregnancy was the
most prevalent risk factor associated with delayed presentation and
reports of delayed presentation in pregnant women ranged from 3 months
to 4 years (5). Delayed _P. falciparum_ in persons from
disease-endemic regions is believed to arise from persistent low-level
parasitemia and decaying _P. falciparum_-specific immunity (5). In
pregnant women, pregnancy-related immunosuppression, sequestration of
_P. falciparum_ parasites in the placenta, and, possibly, placental
antigen expression might increase the risk for delayed _P. falciparum_
presentation (10-12). The patient's sickle cell trait might have also
contributed to the latency of her delayed presentation. Sickle cell
trait protects against severe disease from _P. falciparum_ infection
and is associated with lower parasite densities and delayed malaria
(13,14).

Most malaria cases in the United States are related to travel to a
disease-endemic region. However, malaria can rarely be acquired
locally through mosquito bite, transfusion, or other parenteral route,
transplantation, or during pregnancy or childbirth (15). Our
case-patient had no known history of transfusion or transplantation,
and her infant did not show development of malaria. Although the
patient denied traveling to a disease-endemic area, she was not
available for follow-up, and we were unable to verify travel history
through a passport review. Therefore, undisclosed travel to a
malaria-endemic country remains an unlikely possibility.

Malaria should be considered in all patients from disease-endemic
regions who have compatible symptoms regardless of time since
exposure. Clinical suspicion should be heightened in persons who have
underlying risk factors for delayed manifestation, including
pregnancy, immunosuppression, and sickle cell trait. To rule out the
possibility that a patient without recent travel risk acquired malaria
locally, rigorous public health investigation is required. Components
of an investigation might include medical and travel record review,
environmental surveillance, case finding, and syndromic and death
surveillance with consideration of temporospatial proximity to the
case.

[I would guess that the clinicians were surprised that falciparum
malaria was found here and some of the relapsing species were more
likely considered. While _Anopheles_ mosquitoes do exist in much of
the USA, their density is less than in malaria-endemic areas and more
seasonal. It is indeed possible that the pregnancy and sickle cell
trait were involved here as speculated. Clinicians should take note of
such cases as if this occurred in the southern USA, during warmer
months, secondary autochthonous cases may have occurred. Most of the
deaths from malaria are related to falciparum, so-called malignant
tertian malaria. - Mod.LL

-------------------------------------------------------------------------=0D=
<br>_Plasmodium falciparum_ malaria is a major cause of illness and death<b=
r>worldwide (1). In disease-hyperendemic areas, most of the population<br>a=
re parasitemic (2). Chronic exposure results in partial immunity, and<br>si=
ckle cell trait reduces the severity of infection (3,4). Delayed _P.<br>fal=
ciparum_ malaria after immigration to nonendemic countries has been<br>repo=
rted in the literature, and pregnancy is the most common risk<br>factor for=
 this unusual presentation (5).=0D<br>=0D<br>Former residents of disease-en=
demic areas who have _P. falciparum_<br>malaria without recent travel risk =
present a public health challenge<br>because locally acquired mosquito-born=
e transmission of the parasite<br>must be ruled out, given the widespread d=
istribution of _Anopheles_<br>spp. mosquito vectors in the United States (6=
-8). We report the<br>clinical and public health investigation of a case of=
 delayed _P.<br>falciparum_ malaria in a pregnant woman 11 years after immi=
gration to<br>the USA from sub-Saharan Africa.=0D<br>=0D<br>The Study=0D<br=
>---------=0D<br>The patient was a 20-30-year-old multiparous pregnant woma=
n from<br>sub-Saharan Africa who came to an emergency department at Provide=
nce<br>Portland Medical Center, Portland, Oregon, USA, during her 3rd<br>tr=
imester; she had inadequate prenatal care and a 2-week history of<br>loose =
stools and abdominal pain before defecation. She reported chills<br>and nig=
ht sweats without fevers. She denied nausea, vomiting,<br>epigastric pain, =
runny nose, cough, sore throat, lymphadenopathy,<br>dysuria, or vaginal dis=
charge. The patient was tachycardic; fetal<br>heart rate (FHR) tracing show=
ed a normal FHR, moderate variability,<br>accelerations, and late and varia=
ble decelerations. Initial laboratory<br>evaluation on the woman showed mic=
rocytic anemia, leukocytopenia,<br>thrombocytopenia, and an increased level=
 of bilirubin (Table [for<br>Table and Figures, see original URL - Mod.LL])=
.=0D<br>=0D<br>Testing results were negative for HIV, SARS-CoV-2, influenza=
,<br>hepatitis B, hepatitis C, rubella, and syphilis. The result of a rapid=
<br>point-of-care BinaxNOW malaria test (Abbott Laboratories,<br><a href=3D=

 positive for _P.<br>falciparum_. Thick and thin malaria blood smears showe=
d _P.<br>falciparum_ (Figure 1). Initial parasitemia was 0.2%. We submitted=
<br>blood smears to the Division of Parasitic Diseases and Malaria<br>diagn=
ostic laboratory, Center for Global Health, Centers for Disease<br>Control =
and Prevention, and _P. falciparum_ morphologic identification<br>was confi=
rmed. A pretreatment blood sample was not available for<br>molecular specia=
tion or whole-genome sequencing.=0D<br>=0D<br>We initiated a 3-day course o=
f artemether/lumefantrine, and percentage<br>parasitemia decreased to 0.1% =
within 24 hours. No parasites were<br>observed by day 3 of therapy. The pat=
ient received intravenous fluids<br>and 1 unit of packed red blood cells. M=
aternal tachycardia resolved,<br>and FHR tracing displayed normal FHR with =
moderate variability,<br>accelerations, and resolution of decelerations. Th=
e patient's anemia<br>and thrombocytopenia improved, and her leukocyte coun=
t normalized. The<br>patient gave birth to a healthy post-term infant witho=
ut evidence of<br>placental insufficiency. Placental pathologic analysis sh=
owed sickled<br>maternal erythrocytes, pigment in perivillous fibrin, and m=
ild<br>lymphocytic deciduitis without immunohistochemical evidence of<br>pa=
rasites.=0D<br>=0D<br>The patient immigrated to the USA with her family 11 =
years before she<br>sought care. She had lived in a metropolitan area of Or=
egon during the<br>5 years before she sought care and denied any history of=
 foreign or<br>domestic travel. The patient reported a history of malaria d=
uring<br>childhood 19 years earlier, for which treatment was received while=
<br>living in sub-Saharan Africa. She denied any history of blood<br>transf=
usions or recent insect bites. The most recent visit to the<br>patient's ho=
me by a person from sub-Saharan Africa occurred 2 years<br>before her illne=
ss. She had a history of anemia during previous<br>pregnancies, and her 1st=
 pregnancy was complicated by thrombocytopenia<br>and preeclampsia. She had=
 a history of sickle cell trait diagnosed by<br>hemoglobin fractionation.=0D=
<br>=0D<br>We explored the plausibility of local malaria transmission by<br=
>evaluating current mosquito surveillance data and conducting case<br>findi=
ng with temporospatial proximity to the case. The investigation<br>was anch=
ored to month of symptom onset (September 2022). We used<br>mapping to visu=
alize spatial associations between mosquito<br>surveillance, malaria case r=
eports, syndromic surveillance, and death<br>surveillance (Figure 2).=0D<br=
>=0D<br>_Anopheles freeborni_ and _An. punctipennis_ mosquitoes were<br>ide=
ntified during Washington County Public Health's 2022 Mosquito<br>Control t=
rapping season, May-September 2022. However, during the<br>period of our in=
vestigation, temperatures had decreased, and<br>_Anopheles_ mosquitos were =
not active in the area. _P. falciparum_<br>case finding within the statewid=
e reportable disease database showed 1<br>travel-associated malaria case wi=
th an onset 2 months before this<br>patient and about 4 miles [6.4 km] away=
. There was no epidemiologic<br>link between the cases; whole blood was not=
 available to identify<br>microsatellite parasite signatures. A search of O=
regon's Electronic<br>Surveillance System for the Early Notification of Com=
munity-Based<br>Epidemics for emergency department encounters with a discha=
rge<br>diagnosis of fever of unknown origin (FUO) showed greater than<br>ex=
pected activity in the week of the patient's onset of symptoms (9).<br>Howe=
ver, the trend was not isolated to the proximity of the<br>case-patient, an=
d many encounters noted manifestations consistent with<br>viral infections.=0D=
<br>=0D<br>An Early Notification of Community-Based Epidemics query for mos=
quito<br>bites and arboviral diseases did not show greater than expected<br=
>activity. A vital records query for deaths with an associated<br>diagnosis=
 of FUO showed 1 death temporospatially related to the case.<br>Medical rec=
ord review by the Malaria Branch, Center for Global Health,<br>Division of =
Parasitic Diseases and Malaria, Centers for Disease<br>Control and Preventi=
on, ruled out the death as related to malaria due<br>to clinical and labora=
tory incompatibility. Thus, there was no<br>evidence to support local mosqu=
ito-borne transmission.=0D<br>=0D<br>Conclusions=0D<br>-----------=0D<br>We=
 report a case of _P. falciparum_ malaria in a pregnant woman 11<br>years a=
fter immigration from sub-Saharan Africa to the USA. To assess<br>for local=
 mosquito-borne transmission, a joint state and local public<br>health inve=
stigation examined mosquito surveillance data, performed<br>case finding fo=
r additional malaria cases, and reviewed syndromic<br>surveillance and deat=
h surveillance for FUO diagnoses with<br>temporospatial proximity to the ca=
se. This comprehensive assessment<br>enabled the public health departments =
to effectively evaluate local<br>mosquito-borne transmission and emerging l=
ocal risk.=0D<br>=0D<br>Although delayed _P. falciparum_ illness has been d=
ocumented, it<br>remains rare, and the patient's latency period was unusual=
ly long at<br>11 years. In 1 case series and literature review, pregnancy w=
as the<br>most prevalent risk factor associated with delayed presentation a=
nd<br>reports of delayed presentation in pregnant women ranged from 3 month=
s<br>to 4 years (5). Delayed _P. falciparum_ in persons from<br>disease-end=
emic regions is believed to arise from persistent low-level<br>parasitemia =
and decaying _P. falciparum_-specific immunity (5). In<br>pregnant women, p=
regnancy-related immunosuppression, sequestration of<br>_P. falciparum_ par=
asites in the placenta, and, possibly, placental<br>antigen expression migh=
t increase the risk for delayed _P. falciparum_<br>presentation (10-12). Th=
e patient's sickle cell trait might have also<br>contributed to the latency=
 of her delayed presentation. Sickle cell<br>trait protects against severe =
disease from _P. falciparum_ infection<br>and is associated with lower para=
site densities and delayed malaria<br>(13,14).=0D<br>=0D<br>Most malaria ca=
ses in the United States are related to travel to a<br>disease-endemic regi=
on. However, malaria can rarely be acquired<br>locally through mosquito bit=
e, transfusion, or other parenteral route,<br>transplantation, or during pr=
egnancy or childbirth (15). Our<br>case-patient had no known history of tra=
nsfusion or transplantation,<br>and her infant did not show development of =
malaria. Although the<br>patient denied traveling to a disease-endemic area=
, she was not<br>available for follow-up, and we were unable to verify trav=
el history<br>through a passport review. Therefore, undisclosed travel to a=
<br>malaria-endemic country remains an unlikely possibility.=0D<br>=0D<br>M=
alaria should be considered in all patients from disease-endemic<br>regions=
 who have compatible symptoms regardless of time since<br>exposure. Clinica=
l suspicion should be heightened in persons who have<br>underlying risk fac=
tors for delayed manifestation, including<br>pregnancy, immunosuppression, =
and sickle cell trait. To rule out the<br>possibility that a patient withou=
t recent travel risk acquired malaria<br>locally, rigorous public health in=
vestigation is required. Components<br>of an investigation might include me=
dical and travel record review,<br>environmental surveillance, case finding=
, and syndromic and death<br>surveillance with consideration of temporospat=
ial proximity to the<br>case.=0D<br>=0D<br>References=0D<br>----------=0D<b=

here and some of the relapsing species were more<br>likely considered. Whil=
e _Anopheles_ mosquitoes do exist in much of<br>the USA, their density is l=
ess than in malaria-endemic areas and more<br>seasonal. It is indeed possib=
le that the pregnancy and sickle cell<br>trait were involved here as specul=
ated. Clinicians should take note of<br>such cases as if this occurred in t=

 have occurred. Most of the<br>deaths from malaria are related to falciparu=
