In mid-June [2023], 3 children from the same primary school in Lier
were diagnosed with pork tapeworm infection. The Healthcare Department
is still investigating the source of infection, but the risk of more
infections is extremely small. The school, parents, and the primary
care zone of Lier were informed and supported.

The pork tapeworm is very rare and [is not thought to - Mod.LL] occur
in Belgium or Europe. The source is most likely contaminated food of
foreign origin. The investigation into the source of the contamination
is ongoing. During the summer holidays, the Care Department started a
stool test among about 50 teachers and their family members and
several people involved in preparing food at school. The results of
this study are expected during this month [I was not able to find such
results - Mod.LL]. In addition, the Department of Care is also
launching a survey among parents about possible travel to areas where
pork tapeworm occurs and their dietary patterns.

Joris Moonens, spokesperson for the Department of Care: "We currently
have no hypothesis as to where the children could have become
infected. Pork tapeworm does not occur here, and the only link we see
between the children is that they go to the same school. The
infections could also have happened years ago and are only now causing
symptoms. We must therefore take into account that we will not be able
to find out where the source of the contamination was. Nevertheless,
we estimate the chance of further infections to be extremely small.
Pork tapeworm does not occur here, and the 3 infected children
themselves are and were not contagious."

We ask parents to be vigilant, especially in case of symptoms such as
prolonged headaches, epilepsy, or vision problems. The general
practitioners and pediatricians in the area are aware. Two new
information sessions are planned at the school next week. The
Department of Care and the school work very closely and well
together.

ProMED was not aware of this report when the incident was first
reported and would like more up-to-date information about the cases
and the cluster follow-up. The specific manifestations of _Taenia
solium_ infestation in the schoolchildren is not stated, but the
symptoms mentioned in the last paragraph suggests that the disease was
neurocysticercosis. Cysticercosis is due to infestation with the
intermediate (larval) form of the trematode and is acquired, not by
ingesting food containing the larval form, but rather ingestion of
food or water containing _Taenia_ eggs. The latter would occur if a
food preparer who was harboring the adult pork tapeworm contaminated
the food with the microscopic eggs. Neurocysticercosis generally
occurs in adults (the ages of the children were not stated but they
were primary school students).

Cysticercosis, therefore, is not an infestation acquired by eating
tainted pork. An example of a larger outbreak of neurocysticercosis,
which occurred in Orthodox Jews who did not eat pork, is shown here:

Schantz PM, Moore AC, Mu=F1oz JL, et al. Neurocysticercosis in an
Orthodox Jewish community in New York City. N Engl J Med. 1992; 327:

"Abstract
-------
Background and methods: From June 1990 through July 1991,
intracerebral infection with the larval stage of the pork tapeworm
_Taenia solium_ was diagnosed in 4 unrelated persons in an Orthodox
Jewish community in New York City. None of the patients had eaten
pork, and only one had traveled to a country in which _T. solium_
infection was endemic. We investigated this outbreak, screened serum
samples from family members and household contacts for antibodies to
cysticercosis, and examined stool specimens from household employees
for eggs of _Taenia_ species.

Results: The 4 patients had recurrent seizures and brain lesions that
were radiologically consistent with the presence of cysticerci. The
diagnosis was confirmed in 2 patients by a brain biopsy, and in 2 by
immunoblot assays for cysticercus antibodies. Of 17 immediate family
members screened serologically, 7 from 2 families had cysticercus
antibodies. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed cystic
lesions in 2 of the seropositive family members, one of whom had had a
seizure. Examinations of 6 domestic employees from all 4 households
revealed an active infection with _Taenia_ species in one and a
positive serologic test in another. Since these women had recently
emigrated from Latin American countries where _T. solium_ infection is
endemic, they were the most likely sources of infection in the members
of these households.

Conclusions: A diagnosis of neurocysticercosis should be considered in
patients with seizures and radiologic evidence of cystic brain
lesions, even in those who do not eat pork and who have not traveled
to a country in which _T. solium_ infection is endemic. Recent
emigrants from countries in which _T. solium_ infection is endemic
should be screened for tapeworm infection in their stools before they
are employed as housekeepers or food handlers."

A follow-up serostudy of this population, which I helped run, found a
significant seropositive rate in the community:

Moore AC, Lutwick LI, Schantz PM, et al. Seroprevalence of
cysticercosis in an Orthodox Jewish community. Am J Trop Med Hyg.

Abstract
-------
"Neurocysticercosis cases were identified in 1991 in an Orthodox
Jewish community. Transmission was linked to tapeworm-infected
immigrant housekeepers from countries where _Taenia solium_ is
endemic. To evaluate the extent of and risks for locally acquired
cysticercosis, a seroprevalence survey was conducted in 9% of the
households in this community. Cysticercosis antibodies were detected
in 23 (1.3%) of 1789 persons from 612 families. All 23 seropositive
persons were asymptomatic, and no intracerebral lesions were found for
the 21 seropositive persons who underwent brain imaging.
Seropositivity was associated with female sex (relative risk [RR] =3D
2.45, P =3D 0.049), hiring a domestic worker for childcare duties (RR =3D
3.79, P =3D 0.05), and with employees from Central America (RR =3D 2.70, P
=3D 0.0001). Exposure to _T. solium_ in this community is unexpectedly
high. Widespread employment of domestic workers from endemic regions
and high employee turnover contributes to exposure risk."

A similar study in the schoolchildren could reveal more asymptomatic
cases. Three cases in one school in a non-endemic area certainly
suggests that a food preparer, probably in the school, carrying adult
_T. solium_ was the source, but the transmission could certainly have
occurred substantially before the diagnoses were made. - Mod.LL

The question of whether western European countries are actually free
of pork tapeworms is an interesting one. From the standpoint of
commercial swine herds the answer is likely yes. However, feral swine
are another matter. Any swine with access to their external
environment would also be at significant risk, especially in areas
with feral swine. As proposed in this article
(<https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0001706X15300838>)
the perceived low prevalence/absence of pork tapeworms is likely to be
as much a function of underreporting and/or low testing levels as it
is a true absence of the pathogen. - Mod.JH

t-varkenslintworm-geen-reden-tot-ongerustheid</a>=0D<br>=0D<br>=0D<br>In mi=
d-June [2023], 3 children from the same primary school in Lier<br>were diag=
nosed with pork tapeworm infection. The Healthcare Department<br>is still i=
nvestigating the source of infection, but the risk of more<br>infections is=
 extremely small. The school, parents, and the primary<br>care zone of Lier=
 were informed and supported.=0D<br>=0D<br>The pork tapeworm is very rare a=
nd [is not thought to - Mod.LL] occur<br>in Belgium or Europe. The source i=
s most likely contaminated food of<br>foreign origin. The investigation int=
o the source of the contamination<br>is ongoing. During the summer holidays=
, the Care Department started a<br>stool test among about 50 teachers and t=
heir family members and<br>several people involved in preparing food at sch=
ool. The results of<br>this study are expected during this month [I was not=
 able to find such<br>results - Mod.LL]. In addition, the Department of Car=
e is also<br>launching a survey among parents about possible travel to area=
s where<br>pork tapeworm occurs and their dietary patterns.=0D<br>=0D<br>Jo=
ris Moonens, spokesperson for the Department of Care: "We currently<br>have=
 no hypothesis as to where the children could have become<br>infected. Pork=
 tapeworm does not occur here, and the only link we see<br>between the chil=
dren is that they go to the same school. The<br>infections could also have =
happened years ago and are only now causing<br>symptoms. We must therefore =
take into account that we will not be able<br>to find out where the source =
of the contamination was. Nevertheless,<br>we estimate the chance of furthe=
r infections to be extremely small.<br>Pork tapeworm does not occur here, a=
nd the 3 infected children<br>themselves are and were not contagious."=0D<b=
r>=0D<br>We ask parents to be vigilant, especially in case of symptoms such=
 as<br>prolonged headaches, epilepsy, or vision problems. The general<br>pr=
actitioners and pediatricians in the area are aware. Two new<br>information=
 sessions are planned at the school next week. The<br>Department of Care an=
d the school work very closely and well<br>together.=0D<br>=0D<br>--=0D<br>=
Communicated by:=0D<br>ProMED<br><br>[Lier is located in Antwerp province i=
n northern Belgium.=0D<br>=0D<br>ProMED was not aware of this report when t=
he incident was first<br>reported and would like more up-to-date informatio=
n about the cases<br>and the cluster follow-up. The specific manifestations=
 of _Taenia<br>solium_ infestation in the schoolchildren is not stated, but=
 the<br>symptoms mentioned in the last paragraph suggests that the disease =
was<br>neurocysticercosis. Cysticercosis is due to infestation with the<br>=
intermediate (larval) form of the trematode and is acquired, not by<br>inge=
sting food containing the larval form, but rather ingestion of<br>food or w=
ater containing _Taenia_ eggs. The latter would occur if a<br>food preparer=
 who was harboring the adult pork tapeworm contaminated<br>the food with th=
e microscopic eggs. Neurocysticercosis generally<br>occurs in adults (the a=
ges of the children were not stated but they<br>were primary school student=
s).=0D<br>=0D<br>Cysticercosis, therefore, is not an infestation acquired b=
y eating<br>tainted pork. An example of a larger outbreak of neurocysticerc=
osis,<br>which occurred in Orthodox Jews who did not eat pork, is shown her=
e:=0D<br>=0D<br>Schantz PM, Moore AC, Mu=F1oz JL, et al. Neurocysticercosis=

<br>"Abstract=0D<br>-------=0D<br>Background and methods: From June 1990 th=
rough July 1991,<br>intracerebral infection with the larval stage of the po=
rk tapeworm<br>_Taenia solium_ was diagnosed in 4 unrelated persons in an O=
rthodox<br>Jewish community in New York City. None of the patients had eate=
n<br>pork, and only one had traveled to a country in which _T. solium_<br>i=
nfection was endemic. We investigated this outbreak, screened serum<br>samp=
les from family members and household contacts for antibodies to<br>cystice=
rcosis, and examined stool specimens from household employees<br>for eggs o=
f _Taenia_ species.=0D<br>=0D<br>Results: The 4 patients had recurrent seiz=
ures and brain lesions that<br>were radiologically consistent with the pres=
ence of cysticerci. The<br>diagnosis was confirmed in 2 patients by a brain=
 biopsy, and in 2 by<br>immunoblot assays for cysticercus antibodies. Of 17=
 immediate family<br>members screened serologically, 7 from 2 families had =
cysticercus<br>antibodies. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed c=
ystic<br>lesions in 2 of the seropositive family members, one of whom had h=
ad a<br>seizure. Examinations of 6 domestic employees from all 4 households=
<br>revealed an active infection with _Taenia_ species in one and a<br>posi=
tive serologic test in another. Since these women had recently<br>emigrated=
 from Latin American countries where _T. solium_ infection is<br>endemic, t=
hey were the most likely sources of infection in the members<br>of these ho=
useholds.=0D<br>=0D<br>Conclusions: A diagnosis of neurocysticercosis shoul=
d be considered in<br>patients with seizures and radiologic evidence of cys=
tic brain<br>lesions, even in those who do not eat pork and who have not tr=
aveled<br>to a country in which _T. solium_ infection is endemic. Recent<br=
>emigrants from countries in which _T. solium_ infection is endemic<br>shou=
ld be screened for tapeworm infection in their stools before they<br>are em=
ployed as housekeepers or food handlers."=0D<br>=0D<br>A follow-up serostud=

-----------------------------=0D<br>Abstract=0D<br>-------=0D<br>"Neurocyst=
icercosis cases were identified in 1991 in an Orthodox<br>Jewish community.=
 Transmission was linked to tapeworm-infected<br>immigrant housekeepers fro=
m countries where _Taenia solium_ is<br>endemic. To evaluate the extent of =
and risks for locally acquired<br>cysticercosis, a seroprevalence survey wa=
s conducted in 9% of the<br>households in this community. Cysticercosis ant=
ibodies were detected<br>in 23 (1.3%) of 1789 persons from 612 families. Al=
l 23 seropositive<br>persons were asymptomatic, and no intracerebral lesion=
s were found for<br>the 21 seropositive persons who underwent brain imaging=
.<br>Seropositivity was associated with female sex (relative risk [RR] =3D<=
br>2.45, P =3D 0.049), hiring a domestic worker for childcare duties (RR =
=3D<br>3.79, P =3D 0.05), and with employees from Central America (RR =3D 2=
.70, P<br>=3D 0.0001). Exposure to _T. solium_ in this community is unexpec=
tedly<br>high. Widespread employment of domestic workers from endemic regio=
ns<br>and high employee turnover contributes to exposure risk."=0D<br>=0D<b=
r>A similar study in the schoolchildren could reveal more asymptomatic<br>c=
ases. Three cases in one school in a non-endemic area certainly<br>suggests=
 that a food preparer, probably in the school, carrying adult<br>_T. solium=
_ was the source, but the transmission could certainly have<br>occurred sub=
stantially before the diagnoses were made. - Mod.LL=0D<br>=0D<br>The questi=
on of whether western European countries are actually free<br>of pork tapew=
orms is an interesting one. From the standpoint of<br>commercial swine herd=
s the answer is likely yes. However, feral swine<br>are another matter. Any=
 swine with access to their external<br>environment would also be at signif=
icant risk, especially in areas<br>with feral swine. As proposed in this ar=
ticle<br>(<a href=3D"https://u19268662.ct.sendgrid.net/ss/c/TLh_csrC34X_iXp=

ms is likely to be<br>as much a function of underreporting and/or low testi=
