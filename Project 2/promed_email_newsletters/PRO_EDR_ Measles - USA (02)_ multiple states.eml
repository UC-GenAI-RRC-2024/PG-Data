[1] New Jersey case/Pennsylvania update

A measles case has been confirmed in New Jersey while 9 have been
identified in Philadelphia.

The New Jersey case was identified in Camden County, and as of 17 Jan
2024, it remains the only confirmed incident in the state.

"Given the serious consequences of measles and the ease with which it
can be spread, we will be engaged in a large investigative effort
centered on locating and ensuring the immune status of those
individuals who may have been in contact with this patient," said
Camden County health officer Paschal Nwako in a statement.

While Camden is the closest New Jersey county to Philadelphia, health
authorities haven't been able to find a connection between the
infected patient here and the ongoing outbreak in Philadelphia.

The state Department of Health is currently working to find the source
of the infection and to locate and notify people who might have been
exposed to the infected resident.

So far, authorities know that a Camden County resident who was exposed
to measles visited 2 healthcare facilities, one on 5 Jan 2024 and
another on 8 Jan 2024. The time and place of the visits were:
- 5 Jan 2024: Cooper University Healthcare Pediatrics in Voorhees
Township from 11:35 a.m. to 2:32 p.m.
- 8 Jan 2024: Emergency department at Jefferson South Jersey Stratford
Hospital in Stratford from 8 p.m. to 12:38 a.m.

This is the first confirmed case of measles reported in New Jersey
since March 2023.

Health officials in Delaware said that 20 to 30 people may have been
exposed to measles by an infectious person at Nemours Children's
Hospital in Wilmington on 29 Dec 2023.

In Virginia and Washington, DC, authorities issued a news release
warning travelers who earlier this year [2024] went through Dulles
International Airport and the Ronald Reagan Washington National
Airport of a possible exposure to a person with measles. The person
had recently returned to the U.S. from abroad.

The U.S. measles cases are rising amid a measles outbreak in the U.K.,
where more than 1600 people were infected in 2023 and some 50 patients
have been hospitalized there in the past month.

Experts agree that the 2-dose measles vaccine - available since 1963 -
is the best way to prevent the viral infection.

Why has measles become common again?
------------------------------------
While progress has been made toward the global eradication of measles,
millions of children missed their measles vaccine during the COVID-19
pandemic. That caused a spike of 43% more cases in 2022 compared to
2021, the CDC reported.

The decline in vaccination rates during the pandemic caused large
outbreaks in some 37 countries, causing 128 000 deaths, the World
Health Organization reported.

In 2019, before the pandemic, the CDC recorded 1274 individual cases
of measles that were confirmed in 31 states, the greatest number of
cases reported in the U.S. since 1992.

Back then, 12 cases were identified in Ocean and Monmouth counties.

What is measles and how does it spread?
---------------------------------------
Measles is an airborne viral illness, considered one of the world's
most contagious diseases. It can lead to severe complications and
death, especially in children under 5 and pregnant women.

As an airborne virus, it spreads through tiny nasal and throat
droplets in the air and on surfaces after those who are infected
sneeze or cough. Once the virus is in the air or on surfaces, it can
remain active for up to 2 hours.

Measles symptoms usually begin 10 to 14 days after exposure. The first
phase of symptoms typically lasts between 4 and 7 days and includes:
- Runny nose
- Cough
- Red and watery eyes
- Small white spots inside the cheeks

Then comes a reddish rash. It usually starts on the face and upper
neck, spreading to hands and feet over 3 days. The rash can be itchy
and lasts around 6 days before fading.

Other symptoms include:
- Swollen eyes
- Fever
- Loss of appetite
- Fatigue

Measles can leave children extremely vulnerable as the virus also
weakens their immune system. That can lead to complications,
including:
- Severe diarrhea
- Brain infections
- Ear infections
- Pneumonia
- Blindness

What can parents do to minimize risk?
-------------------------------------
Vaccination is the most effective way to prevent measles. The vaccine
comes in 2 doses that are usually administered before age 2.

If your child is infected with measles, keeping them well-nourished
and providing vitamin A supplements can reduce the risk of
complications, according to the World Health Organization.

Washing hands often and using N95 facemasks can reduce the risk of
contracting measles, according to the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration.

The measles vaccine is considered safe and affordable and often is
combined with immunization for mumps and rubella.

Any person that is not immune to the virus can get measles regardless
of age. Measles infections tends to be more severe in children under
5, pregnant women and adults over 30.

measles-case-passed-through-dc-area-airports-dulles-international-ronald-re=
agan-washington-national-january-3-and-4-dc-health-virginia-department>


Health officials issued a warning over a "potential measles exposure"
after a "confirmed case" of a person who traveled through 2 airports
at the nation's capital.

DC Health stated Tuesday [16 Jan 2024] it was notified of the case.
The infected person was returning from "international travel" and
traveled through 2 DC area airports on 3 Jan 2024.

That person reportedly was in the international arrivals area of the
main terminal at Dulles International Airport from between 4 p.m. and
8 p.m. on 3 Jan 2024.

Then the following day, the person was at Ronald Reagan Washington
National Airport's Terminal A between 2:30 p.m. and 6:30 p.m.

DC Health's warning comes after the Virginia Department of Health
sounded the alarm on Friday [12 Jan 2024] regarding the same possible
measles exposure.

Health officials reminded the public that the "threat of transmission
is low." They did warn those who have not received the measles vaccine
may be at risk for developing the disease.

If you believe you were at one of these locations at the time of the
potential exposure, DC Health recommends:

Anyone who was exposed and is at risk of developing measles should
watch for symptoms, as described below, until 25 Jan 2024. Those
symptoms listed are:
- Fever of 103F-105F
- Anorexia
- Fatigue
- Cough
- Conjunctivitis
- Bluish-gray spots in the mouth
- Telltale rash

If you notice symptoms of measles, immediately isolate yourself by
staying home and away from others. Officials stressed those who may be
infected to immediately contact their healthcare provider.

Call ahead before going to your healthcare provider's office or the
emergency room to notify them that you may have been exposed to
measles and ask them to call the health department. This will help
protect other patients and staff.

If you have received 2 doses of a measles vaccine, or were born before
1957, you are protected and do not need to take any action, according
to the statement issued by DC Health.

If you have an immunocompromising condition, please consult with your
healthcare provider if you have questions or develop symptoms.

If you have received only one dose of a measles vaccine, you are very
likely to be protected and your risk of being infected with measles
from any of these exposures is very low. However, to achieve complete
immunity, contact your healthcare provider about getting a second
vaccine dose.

The incubation period of measles from exposure to the onset of
symptoms ranges from 7-12 days. The rash appears 2-4 days after the
onset of symptoms and lasts 3-5 days. The rash starts at the hairline
and then proceeds to the face and upper neck, later spreading down the
body and outward to the extremities. Sometimes immunocompromised
patients do not develop a rash. Patients are contagious from 4 days
before the rash appears through 4 days after the rash appears. The
virus is transmitted when an infected person breathes, coughs or
sneezes. The measles virus can remain infectious in the air and on
surfaces for up to 2 hours after an infected person leaves an area.

Health experts are sounding the alarm after 6 measles cases have been
discovered in southwest Washington.

As of last weekend, these new cases have been identified in Clark and
Wahkiakum counties. That prompted tri-county health departments --
which includes Multnomah, Clackamas and Washington counties -- to send
an alert to local clinicians Wednesday [10 Jan 2024].

"We haven't had any confirmed cases here in the tri-county area, so I
think the risk of the general population is low," said Dr. Richard
Bruno, a Multnomah County health officer. "But out of abundance of
caution, wanted to make sure that clinicians knew to keep an eye out
for anybody presenting with measles like symptoms."

According to the CDC, measles symptoms include high fever, cough,
runny nose, and watery eyes.

Measles rash appears 3 to 5 days after the first symptoms.

[Low vaccination rates and international travel continue to be the
primary drivers of measles cases in the United States and abroad. A
renewed focus on what were previously non-controversial public health
vaccinations is desperately needed to combat the ongoing
anti-vaccination movement, which only gained momentum as COVID-19
vaccine misinformation spread. - Mod.JH

<br>In 2019, before the pandemic, the CDC recorded 1274 individual cases<br=

ntagious diseases. It can lead to severe complications and<br>death, especi=
ally in children under 5 and pregnant women.=0D<br>=0D<br>As an airborne vi=
rus, it spreads through tiny nasal and throat<br>droplets in the air and on=
 surfaces after those who are infected<br>sneeze or cough. Once the virus i=
s in the air or on surfaces, it can<br>remain active for up to 2 hours.=0D<=
br>=0D<br>Measles symptoms usually begin 10 to 14 days after exposure. The =
first<br>phase of symptoms typically lasts between 4 and 7 days and include=
s:=0D<br>- Runny nose=0D<br>- Cough=0D<br>- Red and watery eyes=0D<br>- Sma=
ll white spots inside the cheeks=0D<br>=0D<br>Then comes a reddish rash. It=
 usually starts on the face and upper<br>neck, spreading to hands and feet =
over 3 days. The rash can be itchy<br>and lasts around 6 days before fading=
.=0D<br>=0D<br>Other symptoms include:=0D<br>- Swollen eyes=0D<br>- Fever=0D=
<br>- Loss of appetite=0D<br>- Fatigue=0D<br>=0D<br>Measles can leave child=

althcare provider.=0D<br>=0D<br>Call ahead before going to your healthcare =
provider's office or the<br>emergency room to notify them that you may have=
 been exposed to<br>measles and ask them to call the health department. Thi=
s will help<br>protect other patients and staff.=0D<br>=0D<br>If you have r=
eceived 2 doses of a measles vaccine, or were born before<br>1957, you are =
protected and do not need to take any action, according<br>to the statement=
 issued by DC Health.=0D<br>=0D<br>If you have an immunocompromising condit=
ion, please consult with your<br>healthcare provider if you have questions =
or develop symptoms.=0D<br>=0D<br>If you have received only one dose of a m=
easles vaccine, you are very<br>likely to be protected and your risk of bei=
ng infected with measles<br>from any of these exposures is very low. Howeve=
r, to achieve complete<br>immunity, contact your healthcare provider about =
getting a second<br>vaccine dose.=0D<br>=0D<br>The incubation period of mea=
sles from exposure to the onset of<br>symptoms ranges from 7-12 days. The r=
ash appears 2-4 days after the<br>onset of symptoms and lasts 3-5 days. The=
 rash starts at the hairline<br>and then proceeds to the face and upper nec=
k, later spreading down the<br>body and outward to the extremities. Sometim=
es immunocompromised<br>patients do not develop a rash. Patients are contag=
ious from 4 days<br>before the rash appears through 4 days after the rash a=
ppears. The<br>virus is transmitted when an infected person breathes, cough=
