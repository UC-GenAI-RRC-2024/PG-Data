Kuching and Bintulu have been declared rabies-infected areas.

Sarawak Minister for Food Industry, Commodity and Regional Development
Datuk Stephen Rundi Utom said of the 16 samples collected, 12 dogs
tested positive for rabies, 8 of which were in Kuching, 1 each in
Padawan and Bau, and 2 in Bintulu.

"All dogs tested are free-roaming and unvaccinated. Therefore, I would
like to remind the public to take extra precautions and go to the
clinic if bitten by an animal without fail," he said in a statement
here today [16 Jan 2024].

Rundi said, earlier today [16 Jan 2024], he had also signed the
anti-rabies vaccination order under Section 40 (1) Veterinary Public
Health Ordinance 1999 which requires that all dogs within the state to
be submitted to anti-rabies vaccination and annual booster.

He said dog owners must also be responsible for ensuring their pets
are vaccinated with the anti-rabies vaccine.

"Any owner or person in charge of a dog who fails to comply shall be
liable to a fine of up to RM2500 [USD 530]. Dogs that are already
exposed to rabies and do not have proper evidence of vaccination will
be put to sleep," he said.

Rundi said the Sarawak Department of Veterinary Services (DVS)
together with the Immune Belt Enforcement Team and Sarawak Security
and Enforcement Unit (UKPS) had intensified the anti-rabies
vaccination programmes throughout the state.

"The public can get their free dog anti-rabies vaccination at any
government's veterinary offices during office hours or during the mass
vaccination programme which will be announced from time to time on the
official Sarawak DVS Facebook page. This year [2024] we target to
vaccinate up to 50 000 dogs," he said.

According to the State Health Department, Sarawak recorded 16 deaths
last year [2023] from 18 human rabies cases.

The cumulative total human rabies cases since July 2017 now stood at
73, with 66 deaths.

[The following are some highlights of the challenges for rabies
elimination in ASEAN Member States:
"- AMS have a target to vaccinate at least 70% of the dog population
-- this target is not reached in most settings.
- Parenteral vaccine presents well-known challenges for vaccinating
stray dogs; oral rabies vaccine may support increasing vaccination
coverage=20
- Budget allocation for purchasing, distributing, and administering
canine rabies vaccines falls short of requirements in most AMS.=20
- Limited resources and staff in animal health sector, including
limited ability to engage private contractors to support mass dog
vaccination efforts.
- Dog bite victims not accessing post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) due
to lack of awareness of rabies risk, difficulties accessing health
services, and costs of treatment.
- Gaps in access to PEP are particularly pronounced in rural and
remote areas, where most rabies deaths occur."

In terms of travelers' health, CDC indicates that "Rabid dogs are
commonly found in Malaysia. However, if you are bitten or scratched by
a dog or other mammal while in Malaysia, rabies treatment is often
available. Consider rabies vaccination before your trip if your
activities mean you will be around dogs or wildlife.

"Travelers more likely to encounter rabid animals include
=E2=80=A2 Campers, adventure travelers, or cave explorers (spelunkers)
=E2=80=A2 Veterinarians, animal handlers, field biologists, or laboratory
workers handling animal specimens
=E2=80=A2 Visitors to rural areas

"Since children are more likely to be bitten or scratched by a dog or
other animals, consider rabies vaccination for children traveling to
Malaysia".
(<https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/malaysia>)

It is expected that the enhanced regulation coupled with appropriate
measures for stray dogs will lead to the owned-dog full vaccination
coverage in the 2 cities. - Mod.ST]

Stampin [federal constituency] MP [Member of Parliament] Chong Chieng
Jen today [15 Jan 2024] urged the state government and the Kuching
South City Council (MBKS) to implement a strays-free environment in
the city following recent rabid dog bite incidents in a housing
estate.

However, he explained that he is not advocating for the senseless
culling of stray dogs, proposing instead for the government to set
aside a plot of land to keep the stray dogs caught by MBKS and test
them for rabies.

"Stray dogs found to be positive will need to be culled while the
non-infected ones will be neutered," he said in a statement.

He said anyone claiming to be the owner of the dogs caught by MBKS can
always claim back the dog subject to reimbursing MBKS for the expenses
incurred and payment of a fine imposed for letting out the dogs. Chong
urged the state government and MBKS to take immediate action in the
interest of public safety.

He said the recent rabid dog bite incidents incident involving 11
victims at Tabuan Desa Indah has exposed the lackadaisical attitude
and ineffectiveness of the state government and MBKS in handling the
rabies control in the city.

All dog-bite victims in Sarawak are reported to be stable and have
been administered rabies vaccination and rabies immunoglobulin (RIG)
treatment, the Health Ministry (MOH) said today [14 Jan 2024].

In a statement regarding the rabies-infected dog situation in Kuching,
Sarawak, the ministry said that the cases involve 11 individuals who
were treated as outpatients and one case who was admitted to the
hospital for wound debridement and was discharged last Thursday [11
Jan 2024].

All 11 cases were bitten by the same stray dog, which was captured by
the local authority (PBT) on 8 Jan [2024]. The laboratory test
conducted by the Veterinary Services Department (DVS) on 11 Jan [2024]
confirmed a positive rabies status.

"As for the 12th case, reported to be bitten by a pet dog at Lorong
Tabuan Timur, Kuching, the victim received treatment at the Sarawak
General Hospital on 7 Jan [2024]. The dog was voluntarily surrendered
to the PBT, and subsequent DVS laboratory test confirmed it to be
rabies positive," the statement read.

On 11 Jan [2024], Kuching South City Council (MBKS) mayor Datuk Wee
Hong Seng reported 12 cases of people bitten by infected dogs in the
Tabuan Desa Indah and Lorong Tabuan Timur areas, Sarawak.

MOH said the Sarawak State Health Department, together with DVS, PBT,
and relevant local agencies, would intensify control activities in the
affected areas with the local community, including conducting dog
vaccination campaigns to curb the spread of rabies infection.

According to MOH, rabies infection can be prevented if given early
treatment before being referred to health facilities. The ministry
also outlined several rabies preventive measures, including
immediately washing wounds on the skin or body parts that have been
licked, bitten, or scratched by animals using running water and soap
for at least 15 minutes and ensuring the completion of anti-rabies
vaccination according to scheduled appointments.

MOH also advised the public against handling stray animals, whether
alive or dead, such as dogs and cats, and to report to the DVS or PBT
for further action.

es-bites-11-people-within-a-day/>


A dog infected with rabies bit 11 people in Kuching, Sarawak, within
24 hours on Sunday [7 Jan 2024].

Kuching South City Council mayor Wee Hong Seng said the victims were
aged between 11 and 81. He said he was "disturbed and distressed" by
what happened.

According to DayakDaily, Wee said there was a separate incident where
a pet dog with rabies bit its owner. He said the victims have to go
through the excruciating experience of undergoing treatment and
waiting for months to see if it had been effective in curbing the
disease.

"I am sending my thoughts and best wishes to the families of the 12
people bitten by the rabid dogs and hoping they will have a full
recovery," he said.

Wee said the majority of deaths caused by rabies so far were due to
the victims' failure to report being bitten by dogs. He urged the
public to seek treatment immediately if they were bitten by dogs or
cats, even if they are their own pets.

Sarawak has reported 73 cases involving humans since the outbreak of
rabies was declared in July 2017, with 66 people dead. In 2023, 16
people died from the disease, a slight increase compared to the 14
recorded the year before [2022].

Currently, 11 hospitals in Sarawak offer rabies immunoglobulin jabs
for high-risk cases.

According to a Malay Mail article dated 13 Oct 2023, "The total area
in Sarawak declared as rabies infected since 2017 is 73, said Food
Industry, Commodity and Regional Development Minister Dakuk Seri Dr
Stephen Rundi Utom. He pointed out that this year [2023] 91 dogs, 7
cats, and 2 other animals were positive for rabies out of 572 samples
tested.

"'Animal rabies cases were detected in Kuching (51), Padawan (13),
Samarahan (8), Bintulu (7), Tebedu (6), Lundu (6), Bau (2), Sibu (2),
Lawas (1), Marudi (1), Selangau (1), Siburan (1), and Simunjan (1),'
said Dr Rundi in a statement on the rabies situation in Sarawak.

"Giving further details, he said as of yesterday [12 Oct 2023] the
total number of dogs vaccinated by Department of Veterinary Services
(DVS) Sarawak and Immune Belt Enforcement Team (IBET) across Sarawak
was 36 567 dogs against the targeted 40 000 heads by year-end."
(<https://www.malaymail.com/news/malaysia/2023/10/13/sarawak-minister-says-=
73-areas-in-state-declared-as-rabies-infected/95928>)

"Rabies is endemic in humans and animals in the Asia Pacific Region
(AP Region), with dog-mediated rabies being the predominant source of
disease. However, it is often under-diagnosed, under-reported, and
under-funded, and is therefore considered to be a neglected disease.
Over 95% of human rabies cases are associated with dog bites. Rabies
control and subsequent elimination necessitate a multi-sectoral
collaboration, using a One Health approach to stop disease
transmission at its source."

"As humans have close bonds with dogs, the threat of rabies
transmission remains perpetual unless active surveillance and control
measures are taken in dogs, the region's primary animal reservoirs for
rabies virus. [As rabies is] a zoonotic disease that thrives depending
on socio-cultural, economic, and human-led activities, it is essential
to use a One Health approach in tackling the disease."
(<https://rr-asia.woah.org/en/projects/rabies/>)

The One Health approach in rabies case prevention aligns with the
World Health Organization's (WHO) Global Strategic Plan, aiming to
eliminate human deaths caused by dog-mediated rabies by 2030. -
