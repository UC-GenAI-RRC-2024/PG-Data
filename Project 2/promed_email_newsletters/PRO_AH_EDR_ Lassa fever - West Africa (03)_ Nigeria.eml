Table 1: Summary of the current week (1), cumulative Epi week 1, 2024
and comparison with the previous year (2023)

Current week 1 (1-7 Jan 2024) / Cumulative week 1, 2024 / Cumulative
week 1, 2023
- Suspected cases: 190 / 190 / 143
- Confirmed cases: 53 / 53 / 10
- Probable cases: 0 / 0 / 0
- Deaths: 6 / 6 / 8
- Case fatality rate (CFR [%]): 11.3 / 11.3 / 27.6.
- Number of states affected: 9 / 9 / 6
- Local government areas (LGAs) affected: 27 / 27 / 13

Highlights
----------
- In week 1, the number of new confirmed cases increased from 43 in
epi week 52, 2023 to 53 in epi week 1, 2024 cases. These were reported
in Ondo, Edo, Bauchi, Benue, Taraba, Ebonyi, Enugu, Imo, and Plateau
States (Table 3).
- Cumulatively from week 1, 2024, 6 deaths have been reported with a
case fatality rate (CFR) of 11.3% which is lower than the CFR for the
same period in 2023 (27.6%).
-  In total for 2024, 9 states have recorded at least one confirmed
case across 27 local government areas (Figures 2 and 3).
- 71% of all confirmed Lassa fever cases were reported from these 3
states (Ondo, Edo, and Bauchi) while 29% were reported from 6 states
with confirmed Lassa fever cases. Of the 71% confirmed cases, Ondo
reported 25%, Edo 25%, and Bauchi 21%.
- The predominant age group affected is 21-30 years (range: 4 to 75
years, median age: 32 years). The male-to-female ratio for confirmed
cases is 1:0.9 (Figure 4).
- The number of suspected cases increased compared to that reported
for the same period in 2023.
- 2 new healthcare workers were affected in the reporting week 1.
- National Lassa fever multi-partner, multi-sectoral Emergency
Operations Centre (EOC) activated to coordinate the response
activities at all levels.

Response activities
-------------------
- Confirmed cases are treated at identified treatment centres across
the states
- Dissemination of reviewed case management and safe burial practices
guidelines
- Diagnosis of all samples in Lassa fever testing laboratories across
the country
- Reports on the preparedness survey in the 36 states and FCT to
assess preparedness, readiness, and response to Lassa fever
disseminated
- Dissemination of media content including press releases, tweets,
public advisories, etc.
- Held the first Lassa Fever webinar for 2024 focused on "Empowering
Communities to Combat Lassa Fever"
- Held a meeting with CEPI to strengthen the implementation of
research activities both during the outbreak and at peace time.
- Off-site support on IPC and safe burial to affected states
- Monitoring of outbreak emergency composite indicators to guide
action
- Incident management system/multi-sectoral Public Health Emergency
Operation Centres (PHEOC) activated at the national and some affected
states

Challenges
----------
- Late presentation of cases leading to CFR higher than the national
target
- Poor health-seeking behaviour due to the high cost of treatment and
clinical management of Lassa fever
- Poor environmental sanitation conditions observed in high-burden
communities
- Poor awareness observed in high-burden communities

Notes on this report
--------------------
Data Source: Information for this disease was case-based data
retrieved from the National Lassa fever Emergency Operations Centre.

Case definitions
----------------
- Suspected case: any individual presenting with one or more of the
following: malaise, fever, headache, sore throat, cough, nausea,
vomiting, diarrhoea, myalgia, chest pain, hearing loss, and either (a)
history of contact with excreta or urine of rodents; or (b) history of
contact with a probable or confirmed Lassa fever case within 21 days
of onset of symptoms, OR (c) any person with inexplicable
bleeding/hemorrhagia.
- Confirmed case: any suspected case with laboratory confirmation
(positive IgM antibody, PCR, or virus isolation).
- Probable case: any suspected case (see definition above) who died or
absconded without collection of specimen for laboratory testing.
- Contact: anyone who has been exposed to an infected person, or to an
infected person's secretions, excretions, or tissues within 3 weeks of
last contact with a confirmed or probable case of Lassa fever.

Calculations
------------
- Case fatality rate (CFR) for this disease is reported for confirmed
cases only.

[The number of cases peaked earlier last year (2023) during weeks 2-5.
The graph in Figure 6 shows an early and relatively higher peak in
case numbers last year (2023) compared with earlier years. In most
years, case numbers remain relatively flat on the graph from week 17
onward. It will be interesting to see if cases again rise early this
year (2024). The report above confirms that Ondo, Edo, and Bauchi
states have the most confirmed cases again so far in 2024. The number
of states affected is 9 so far this year (2024), and the number of
local government areas (LGAs) with at least one case is 27.
Unfortunately, 2 new healthcare workers were affected in the reporting
week 1.

Transmission of LF virus occurs when individuals are in contact with
rodent reservoir host excreta or are within healthcare facilities. It
is encouraging to learn from previous reports this year (2024) that
risk communications and community engagement activities have been
scaled up across states in Nigeria using television, radio, print,
social media, and other strategies for avoidance of contact with
rodent virus reservoirs and their excreta. These efforts may have
contributed to the decline in the number of cases over the past
month.

One hopes that the ongoing public information campaign will help the
local population avoid the entry of these reservoir rodents into their
houses and other buildings. - Mod.TY]

Gombe state Commissioner of Health, Dr. Habu Dahiru, has announced the
unfortunate occurrence of the first outbreak of Lassa fever in the
state, urging widespread information sharing to curtail the situation
promptly.

Dr. Dahiru said cases in the state over the past 5 years have created
concerns. He said in 2018, 3 cases were reported while in 2019 and
2020, the number rose to 6 cases each whereas there were no reported
cases in 2021. However, in 2023, the state faced a surge with 24
suspected cases.

The commissioner disclosed that the first confirmed case in 2024 was a
25-year-old driver who had recently travelled to Adamawa and spent 2
weeks there. Upon his return, he exhibited symptoms such as fever,
headache, and abdominal pain. Initially admitted to a local hospital,
the deteriorating condition prompted a referral to the teaching
hospital. A Lassa test was conducted, and the patient was confirmed
positive.

According to him, a systematic approach involving case identification,
isolation, and treatment has been activated. The health system has
implemented a laboratory pillar for the collection of samples from
suspected cases for further investigation.

The commissioner added that a risk communication pillar has been
established to educate the public on the transmission of Lassa fever,
emphasising that the virus is primarily transmitted through rats,
which harbour and spread the infection. He cautioned against improper
food handling practices, such as allowing rats to contaminate stored
food products or leaving utensils exposed overnight.

The commissioner stressed that collective efforts were essential to
contain the outbreak and protect the health of the community.

The Cross River State Ministry of Health has raised an alarm regarding
an outbreak of Lassa fever, leading to one fatality in the Ejah
Community of Osupong Ward 1, Obubra Local Government Area of the
state.

In a statement released on Thursday [18 Jan 2024] and signed by the
Commissioner of Health, Dr. Egbe Ayuk, citizens were informed of the
outbreak, which was confirmed through an investigation into the
deceased, establishing that the cause of death was Lassa fever.

The statement reads: "This is to notify the public of Lassa fever
outbreak in Ejah Community of Osupong Ward 1, Obubra LGA.

"Investigation has been concluded today (Wednesday [17 Jan 2024]), and
details of the deceased, a resident of Obubra, gotten from Federal
University Teaching Hospital Abakaliki, Ebony State -- confirmed he
died of Lassa fever.

"We have consequently activated the Cross River State Emergency
Operation Centre.

"The State Rapid Response Team will be going to Obubra on Thursday [18
Jan 2024] to join the LGA team to ensure: contact tracing, line
listing, and decontamination of affected premises.

"Also, awareness creation and risk communication, as well as
mobilisation of Lassa fever commodities, consumables, and personal
protective equipment to General Hospital Obubra and other locations,
have been activated," Ayuk stated.

[Sporadic cases such as those reported above in Gombe and Cross River
states are not unusual. Transmission is not as frequent as in Ondo,
Edo, and Bauchi states as reported in the national report above or in
2023 reports. Even though these 2 states are not "hot spots" for
transmission, state residents should follow the advice of their health
officials and take the necessary measures needed to avoid contact with
the reservoir rodents and their excreta. - Mod.TY
