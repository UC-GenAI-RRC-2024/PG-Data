_Clostridium perfringens_ linked to BBQ
---------------------------------------
An outbreak of likely _Clostridium perfringens_ was investigated by
the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment and the
Jefferson County Public Health starting on 23 Aug 2023. That day, a
school nurse at Evergreen County Day School reported 40 or so
illnesses following a school event on 21 Aug 2023. The outbreak was
given the state ID "2023-30-129."

A total of 122 primary cases were identified. Of these, for whom
gender was known, 37 were male (30.3%) and 35 were female (28.7%).
Cases were between 1 and 74 years of age, for whom the age was
recorded (majority between 18 and 49 years). Illness onsets were
recorded to have occurred between 21-23 Aug 2023. Illnesses consisted
of mostly diarrhea and cramping, along with some nausea, fatigue,
fever, and vomiting. Most cases fell ill within a day of exposure. No
cases were hospitalized, and no cases died. One case had a stool
specimen tested.=20

A case-control study, conducted via a RedCap survey with all
participants of the BBQ event, and a food preparation review were
conducted in response to this outbreak. A mass communication was sent
out to the school asking symptomatic individuals to submit stool
samples and offer information on their symptoms. As of 23 Aug 2023,
about 122 responses were received from families with symptoms. Three
individuals agreed to submit stool samples, but only one sample was
collected on 24 Aug 2023; unfortunately, this sample did not confirm a
pathogen. However, given the reported symptoms and incubation period,
it was determined with 99.24% probability that the pathogen was _C.
perfringens_.

Exposure was suspected to have occurred on 21 Aug 2023 in Jefferson
County. The common exposure shared among all ill cases was a grade K-8
back-to-school BBQ hosted by the school. Food for this event was
prepared by a brick-and-mortar restaurant, Piggin' Out Smokehouse, and
then transported by and served from a food truck at the school. Food
was delivered to about 400 people. Menu items included
macaroni-and-cheese, chicken, pork, sausage, beans, kale salad, and
quinoa salad. Beverages were iced tea, lemonade, and water.=20

An original outbreak inspection at the restaurant occurred on 22 Aug
2023. It was found that the walk-in-cooler was not functioning
properly. On 24 Aug 2023, a follow up inspection occurred at Piggin'
Out Smokehouse. Based on epidemiological and environmental evidence,
pork and chicken were the suspected sources of illness.

[Unlike staphylococcal foodborne illness, where the preformed toxin is
ingested, in _C. perfringens_ disease the enterotoxin is formed in
situ in the gastrointestinal tract. The following discussion is
obtained from the FDA Bad Bug Book 1st Edition:

"1. Name of the organism
_Clostridium perfringens_ is an anaerobic, Gram-positive,
spore-forming rod. It is widely distributed in the environment and
frequently occurs in the intestines of humans and many domestic and
feral animals. Spores of the organism persist in soil, sediments, and
areas subject to human or animal fecal pollution.

"2. Nature of acute disease
Perfringens food poisoning is the term used to describe the common
foodborne illness caused by _C. perfringens_. A more serious but rare
illness is also caused by ingesting food contaminated with type C
strains. The latter illness is known as enteritis necroticans, or
pig-bel disease.

"3. Nature of disease
The common form of perfringens poisoning is characterized by intense
abdominal cramps and diarrhea, which begin 8-22 hours after
consumption of foods containing large numbers of those _C.
perfringens_ bacteria capable of producing the food poisoning toxin.
The illness is usually over within 24 hours, but less severe symptoms
may persist in some individuals for 1-2 weeks. A few deaths have been
reported as a result of dehydration and other complications.

"Necrotic enteritis (pig-bel) caused by _C. perfringens_ is often
fatal. This disease also begins as a result of ingesting large numbers
of the causative bacteria in contaminated foods. Deaths from necrotic
enteritis (pig-bel syndrome) are caused by infection and necrosis of
the intestines and from resulting septicemia. This disease is very
rare in the USA.

"Infective dose: The symptoms are caused by ingestion of large numbers
(greater than 100 million) vegetative cells. Toxin production in the
digestive tract (or in test tubes) is associated with sporulation.
This disease is a food infection; only one episode has ever implied
the possibility of intoxication (that is, disease from preformed
toxin).

"4. Diagnosis of human illness
Perfringens poisoning is diagnosed by its symptoms and the typical
delayed onset of illness. Diagnosis is confirmed by detecting the
toxin in the feces of patients. Bacteriological confirmation can also
be done by finding exceptionally large numbers of the causative
bacteria in implicated foods or in the feces of patients.

"5. Associated foods
In most instances, the actual cause of poisoning by _C. perfringens_
is temperature abuse of prepared foods. Small numbers of the organisms
are often present after cooking and multiply to food poisoning levels
during cool down and storage of prepared foods. Meats, meat products,
and gravy are the foods most frequently implicated.

"6. Relative frequency of disease
Perfringens poisoning is one of the most commonly reported foodborne
illnesses in the USA. There were 1162 cases in 1981, in 28 separate
outbreaks. At least 10-20 outbreaks have been reported annually in the
USA for the past 2 decades. Typically, dozens or even hundreds of
persons are affected. It is probable that many outbreaks go unreported
because the implicated foods or patient feces are not tested routinely
for _C. perfringens_ or its toxin. CDC estimates that about 10 000
actual cases occur annually in the USA.

"7. Course of disease and complications
The disease generally lasts 24 hours. In the elderly or infirm,
symptoms may last 1-2 weeks. Complications and/or death only very
rarely occur.

"8. Target populations
Institutional feeding (such as school cafeterias, hospitals, nursing
homes, prisons) where large quantities of food are prepared several
hours before serving is the most common circumstance in which
perfringens poisoning occurs. The young and elderly are the most
frequent victims of perfringens poisoning. Except in the case of
pig-bel syndrome, complications are few in persons under 30 years of
age. Elderly persons are more likely to experience prolonged or severe
symptoms.

"9. Food analysis
Standard bacteriological culturing procedures are used to detect the
organism in implicated foods and in feces of patients. Serological
assays are used for detecting enterotoxin in the feces of patients and
for testing the ability of strains to produce toxin. The procedures
take 1-3 days."

ringens_ linked to BBQ=0D<br>---------------------------------------=0D<br>=
An outbreak of likely _Clostridium perfringens_ was investigated by<br>the =
Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment and the<br>Jefferson C=
ounty Public Health starting on 23 Aug 2023. That day, a<br>school nurse at=
 Evergreen County Day School reported 40 or so<br>illnesses following a sch=
ool event on 21 Aug 2023. The outbreak was<br>given the state ID "2023-30-1=
29."=0D<br>=0D<br>A total of 122 primary cases were identified. Of these, f=
or whom<br>gender was known, 37 were male (30.3%) and 35 were female (28.7%=
).<br>Cases were between 1 and 74 years of age, for whom the age was<br>rec=
orded (majority between 18 and 49 years). Illness onsets were<br>recorded t=
o have occurred between 21-23 Aug 2023. Illnesses consisted<br>of mostly di=
arrhea and cramping, along with some nausea, fatigue,<br>fever, and vomitin=
g. Most cases fell ill within a day of exposure. No<br>cases were hospitali=
zed, and no cases died. One case had a stool<br>specimen tested.=20=0D<br>=0D=
<br>A case-control study, conducted via a RedCap survey with all<br>partici=
pants of the BBQ event, and a food preparation review were<br>conducted in =
response to this outbreak. A mass communication was sent<br>out to the scho=
ol asking symptomatic individuals to submit stool<br>samples and offer info=
rmation on their symptoms. As of 23 Aug 2023,<br>about 122 responses were r=
eceived from families with symptoms. Three<br>individuals agreed to submit =
stool samples, but only one sample was<br>collected on 24 Aug 2023; unfortu=
nately, this sample did not confirm a<br>pathogen. However, given the repor=
ted symptoms and incubation period,<br>it was determined with 99.24% probab=
ility that the pathogen was _C.<br>perfringens_.=0D<br>=0D<br>Exposure was =
suspected to have occurred on 21 Aug 2023 in Jefferson<br>County. The commo=
n exposure shared among all ill cases was a grade K-8<br>back-to-school BBQ=
 hosted by the school. Food for this event was<br>prepared by a brick-and-m=
ortar restaurant, Piggin' Out Smokehouse, and<br>then transported by and se=
rved from a food truck at the school. Food<br>was delivered to about 400 pe=
ople. Menu items included<br>macaroni-and-cheese, chicken, pork, sausage, b=
eans, kale salad, and<br>quinoa salad. Beverages were iced tea, lemonade, a=
nd water.=20=0D<br>=0D<br>An original outbreak inspection at the restaurant=
 occurred on 22 Aug<br>2023. It was found that the walk-in-cooler was not f=
unctioning<br>properly. On 24 Aug 2023, a follow up inspection occurred at =
Piggin'<br>Out Smokehouse. Based on epidemiological and environmental evide=
nce,<br>pork and chicken were the suspected sources of illness.=0D<br>=0D<b=
r>--=0D<br>Communicated by:=0D<br>ProMED<br><br>[Unlike staphylococcal food=
borne illness, where the preformed toxin is<br>ingested, in _C. perfringens=
_ disease the enterotoxin is formed in<br>situ in the gastrointestinal trac=
t. The following discussion is<br>obtained from the FDA Bad Bug Book 1st Ed=
ition:=0D<br>=0D<br>"1. Name of the organism=0D<br>_Clostridium perfringens=
_ is an anaerobic, Gram-positive,<br>spore-forming rod. It is widely distri=
buted in the environment and<br>frequently occurs in the intestines of huma=
ns and many domestic and<br>feral animals. Spores of the organism persist i=
n soil, sediments, and<br>areas subject to human or animal fecal pollution.=0D=
<br>=0D<br>"2. Nature of acute disease=0D<br>Perfringens food poisoning is =
the term used to describe the common<br>foodborne illness caused by _C. per=
fringens_. A more serious but rare<br>illness is also caused by ingesting f=
ood contaminated with type C<br>strains. The latter illness is known as ent=
eritis necroticans, or<br>pig-bel disease.=0D<br>=0D<br>"3. Nature of disea=
se=0D<br>The common form of perfringens poisoning is characterized by inten=
se<br>abdominal cramps and diarrhea, which begin 8-22 hours after<br>consum=
ption of foods containing large numbers of those _C.<br>perfringens_ bacter=
ia capable of producing the food poisoning toxin.<br>The illness is usually=
 over within 24 hours, but less severe symptoms<br>may persist in some indi=
viduals for 1-2 weeks. A few deaths have been<br>reported as a result of de=
hydration and other complications.=0D<br>=0D<br>"Necrotic enteritis (pig-be=
l) caused by _C. perfringens_ is often<br>fatal. This disease also begins a=
s a result of ingesting large numbers<br>of the causative bacteria in conta=
minated foods. Deaths from necrotic<br>enteritis (pig-bel syndrome) are cau=
sed by infection and necrosis of<br>the intestines and from resulting septi=
cemia. This disease is very<br>rare in the USA.=0D<br>=0D<br>"Infective dos=
e: The symptoms are caused by ingestion of large numbers<br>(greater than 1=
00 million) vegetative cells. Toxin production in the<br>digestive tract (o=
r in test tubes) is associated with sporulation.<br>This disease is a food =
infection; only one episode has ever implied<br>the possibility of intoxica=
tion (that is, disease from preformed<br>toxin).=0D<br>=0D<br>"4. Diagnosis=
 of human illness=0D<br>Perfringens poisoning is diagnosed by its symptoms =
and the typical<br>delayed onset of illness. Diagnosis is confirmed by dete=
cting the<br>toxin in the feces of patients. Bacteriological confirmation c=
an also<br>be done by finding exceptionally large numbers of the causative<=
br>bacteria in implicated foods or in the feces of patients.=0D<br>=0D<br>"=
5. Associated foods=0D<br>In most instances, the actual cause of poisoning =
by _C. perfringens_<br>is temperature abuse of prepared foods. Small number=
s of the organisms<br>are often present after cooking and multiply to food =
poisoning levels<br>during cool down and storage of prepared foods. Meats, =
meat products,<br>and gravy are the foods most frequently implicated.=0D<br=
>=0D<br>"6. Relative frequency of disease=0D<br>Perfringens poisoning is on=
e of the most commonly reported foodborne<br>illnesses in the USA. There we=
re 1162 cases in 1981, in 28 separate<br>outbreaks. At least 10-20 outbreak=
s have been reported annually in the<br>USA for the past 2 decades. Typical=
ly, dozens or even hundreds of<br>persons are affected. It is probable that=
 many outbreaks go unreported<br>because the implicated foods or patient fe=
ces are not tested routinely<br>for _C. perfringens_ or its toxin. CDC esti=
mates that about 10 000<br>actual cases occur annually in the USA.=0D<br>=0D=
<br>"7. Course of disease and complications=0D<br>The disease generally las=
ts 24 hours. In the elderly or infirm,<br>symptoms may last 1-2 weeks. Comp=
lications and/or death only very<br>rarely occur.=0D<br>=0D<br>"8. Target p=
opulations=0D<br>Institutional feeding (such as school cafeterias, hospital=
s, nursing<br>homes, prisons) where large quantities of food are prepared s=
everal<br>hours before serving is the most common circumstance in which<br>=
perfringens poisoning occurs. The young and elderly are the most<br>frequen=
t victims of perfringens poisoning. Except in the case of<br>pig-bel syndro=
me, complications are few in persons under 30 years of<br>age. Elderly pers=
ons are more likely to experience prolonged or severe<br>symptoms.=0D<br>=0D=
<br>"9. Food analysis=0D<br>Standard bacteriological culturing procedures a=
re used to detect the<br>organism in implicated foods and in feces of patie=
nts. Serological<br>assays are used for detecting enterotoxin in the feces =
of patients and<br>for testing the ability of strains to produce toxin. The=
 procedures<br>take 1-3 days."<br>(<a href=3D"https://u19268662.ct.sendgrid=
