According to Chu Se District Medical Center (Gia Lai province), a toad
meat poisoning case recently occurred in the locality, causing 1 child
to die and 2 children to be hospitalized for emergency treatment.

At around 10:00 a.m. on 11 Jan 2024, the children: [SN] (11 years
old), [SH] (4 years old) and [ST] (5 years old) residing in Tao Roong
village (Ia Pal commune, Chu Se district, Gia Lai province) invited
each other to make toad meat to eat.

At about 11:30 a.m., family members discovered the children lying
motionless on the floor, incontinent of urine, so they took them to
Chu Se District Medical Center for emergency treatment.

At the medical facility, doctors determined [SN] had stopped
circulation and breathing, her pupils were maximally dilated, her
pulse could not be detected, and her blood pressure could not be
measured. After 30 minutes of intensive resuscitation, [SN] could not
survive.

[SH] and [ST] were hospitalized in a state of drowsiness and vomiting,
and were diagnosed by doctors with toad meat poisoning. After being
actively treated by doctors, both children were transferred to Gia Lai
Provincial Children's Hospital for further treatment.

After the incident, Chu Se Medical Center also sent people to monitor,
investigate, verify, grasp the situation and inform the villagers
about the poisoning incident.

Why does eating toad meat cause poisoning?
------------------------------------------
According to the Department of Food Safety (Ministry of Health), for a
long time, people have considered toad meat as a nutritious food for
the elderly, supporting the treatment of children who are lazy to eat
and slow to grow in the form of shrimp paste, powder or fresh meat
used for cooking, cook porridge, and make toad rolls.

However, science has proven the subcutaneous glands, glands behind the
ears, glands above the eyes, eggs and liver of toads contain toxins
such as Bufotalin, Bufotenin, and Bufotonin [All of these are
classified as Bufadienolides]. Therefore, if during processing, these
substances remain on toad meat, they will cause poisoning, which is
very dangerous.

In Dan Tri newspaper, Dr. Ha Thi Bich Van (Head of Emergency
Department, Phu Tho Provincial General Hospital) warned: "The liver,
eggs, skin, pus, eyes and nerve ganglia of toads contain a lot of
substances. toxic, especially bufotoxin. This is an extremely toxic,
heat-stable substance which can cause cardiac arrhythmia and death in
a very short time.

"The toxins in toads are absorbed through the digestive tract.
Therefore, about 1-2 hours after eating, the patient will have the 1st
symptoms such as bloating, abdominal pain above the navel accompanied
by severe vomiting, possibly diarrhea.

"After that, the victim has additional symptoms such as dizziness,
hallucinations, cold sweat, increased salivation, may have difficulty
breathing, apnea, cardiac arrest and other symptoms.

"Although the meat and fat of the toad are not poisonous, if you are
not careful while processing it, toxins from other parts can still
stick to it. The prognosis of meat and toad egg poisoning is very
severe, the risk of death is very high," said Dr. Ha Thi Bich Van.

Dr. Nguyen Trung Nguyen (Director of the Poison Control Center)
commented that during the process of processing toads, it is very easy
to cause the toad's venom glands to rupture. This because the toad's
poison contained in the toad's sap (a milky white secretion) is
"crowded" in the subcutaneous and parotid glands.=20

It is the reason many cases of toad meat poisoning occur even though
all skin, internal organs, and toad eggs have been removed. There are
components in toad venom which are very toxic to the nervous system
and especially the heart. The mortality rate of this type of poisoning
is very high, with some patients dying right at home or on the way to
the hospital.

"Toxins can easily stick to the meat area, and when eaten, poisoning
still occurs as usual," Dr. Nguyen said. Three children died due
eating food which many parents made to nourish their children.

Eating toad meat is very dangerous.

Symptoms of toad meat poisoning
-------------------------------
The toad's secreted mucus can cause burning and swelling in sensitive
areas such as the eyes, mouth, etc.

This toxin is absorbed very quickly through the digestive tract,
poisoning symptoms usually occur about 1 hour after eating, or 15-30
minutes earlier.

Initially, the victim will feel dizzy and have stinging pain in the
fingertips and toes. Next is prolonged severe vomiting, diarrhea,
abdominal pain, and decreased blood pressure.

Then symptoms similar to heart failure such as arrhythmia appear and
become more severe, then death within a few hours.

How to treat toad meat poisoning
--------------------------------
People who are poisoned when eating toad meat have a very high death
rate because of the toxins in the toad. Therefore, it is necessary to
detect early and implement timely first aid and emergency measures at
medical centers.

In case the patient shows early signs of poisoning and is still
conscious: Actively induce vomiting and immediately take the patient
to emergency facilities.

How to eat toad meat to avoid poisoning?
----------------------------------------
According to medical experts, to avoid food poisoning from eating toad
meat, people should only use processed toad meat products in the form
of food and medicine having allowed for circulation by the
authorities.

Do not use purple toads (toads with red eyes) for eating. Only use
meat and bones to process into food and prepare toad meat according to
the correct process (cut off the lower end of the two parotid glands,
cut off 4 feet, peel the skin in a water basin, cut out the anus,
remove all intestines, eggs, liver, bile, rinse several times under
clean water).

[Toxic principles in many toads are the bufadienolides, a chemical
compound with steroid structure. Its derivatives are collectively
known as bufadienolides, including many in the form of bufadienolide
glycosides. These are a type of cardiac glycoside, the other being the
cardenolide glycosides. They can be deadly, as was the case for these
children.=20

This is a tragic story, and a huge warning regarding toad meat. This
toad is not just located in Viet Nam, but throughout the world.=20

While this a tragic story, it provides a warning to travelers, hikers,
explorers, and other groups of outdoor enthusiasts to be aware of
potential harm when consuming certain things on the trail.

The toxic substances found in toads can be divided by chemical
structure into 2 groups:
1. bufadienolides, which are cardiac glycosides (e.g., bufotalin,
bufogenin) (affecting the heart); and
2. tryptamine-related substances (e.g., bufotenin)

Toads known to secrete bufotoxin include
- _Bufo alvarius_
- _Bufo americanus_
- _Bufo arenarum_
- _Bufo asper_
- _Bufo blombergi_
- _Bufo boreas_
- _Bufo bufo_
- _Bufo bufo gargarizans_
- _Bufo gutturalis_
- _Bufo formosus_
- _Bufo fowleri_
- _Rhinella marina (formerly _Bufo marinus_) (This change in naming
may not be accepted universally, as other sources disagree with the
name change. - Mod.TG)
- _Bufo melanostictus_
- _Bufo peltocephalus_
- _Bufo quercicus_
- _Bufo regularis_
- _Bufo valliceps_
- _Bufo viridis_
- _Bufo vulgaris_
(Source: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bufotoxin>)

In dogs, the clinical signs of toad toxicity usually begin with
brick-red mucous membranes, increased salivation, pawing at the mouth,
and vocalizing. This is usually followed by disorientation, circling,
stumbling and falling, and seizures. Some dogs demonstrate an increase
in breathing rate, anxiety, and vomiting and/or diarrhea.

These signs occur within minutes after exposure. Physical examination
may include any of the above clinical signs, as well as an increased
or decreased heart rate and increased body temperature.

As time progresses, the clinical signs can become more severe, leading
to seizures, collapse, and severely irregular heart rhythms, and
eventually death. The time may be quite short, as this article
suggests. Factors affecting the timing may be the size and health of
the victim encountering the toad. Smaller and/or older animals, or
those with other health problems, such as heart conditions, may
succumb to the toxin much quicker.

Toad toxicity is primarily diagnosed by history of contact with a toad
and physical examination. There are no tests available to confirm
absorption of toad toxins; however, general blood work, radiographs
(X-rays), and electrocardiograms are helpful in determining the
required supportive therapies.

The most effective treatment for acute toad toxicity is a complete
flushing of the mouth with running water. Owners should do this
immediately and prior to seeking veterinary care. It is important to
point the dog's head down so the water is not swallowed. If the dog is
having seizures, the mouth should be flushed so the water flows away
from the throat to prevent drowning. Quick action is crucial for a
good outcome.

Once at the clinic, treatment will depend on the clinical signs which
may have developed. Seizures will need to be controlled with
medications. Abnormal heart rates and rhythms must be corrected. Blood
glucose, body temperature, blood pressure, and hydration will be
monitored and controlled. There is no specific antidote for toad
toxins. Once the clinical signs resolve, no further care is necessary,
and your dog can return to normal activities

<br>=0D<br>=0D<br>According to Chu Se District Medical Center (Gia Lai prov=
ince), a toad<br>meat poisoning case recently occurred in the locality, cau=
sing 1 child<br>to die and 2 children to be hospitalized for emergency trea=
tment.=0D<br>=0D<br>At around 10:00 a.m. on 11 Jan 2024, the children: [SN]=
 (11 years<br>old), [SH] (4 years old) and [ST] (5 years old) residing in T=
ao Roong<br>village (Ia Pal commune, Chu Se district, Gia Lai province) inv=
ited<br>each other to make toad meat to eat.=0D<br>=0D<br>At about 11:30 a.=
m., family members discovered the children lying<br>motionless on the floor=
, incontinent of urine, so they took them to<br>Chu Se District Medical Cen=
ter for emergency treatment.=0D<br>=0D<br>At the medical facility, doctors =
determined [SN] had stopped<br>circulation and breathing, her pupils were m=
aximally dilated, her<br>pulse could not be detected, and her blood pressur=
e could not be<br>measured. After 30 minutes of intensive resuscitation, [S=
N] could not<br>survive.=0D<br>=0D<br>[SH] and [ST] were hospitalized in a =
state of drowsiness and vomiting,<br>and were diagnosed by doctors with toa=
d meat poisoning. After being<br>actively treated by doctors, both children=
 were transferred to Gia Lai<br>Provincial Children's Hospital for further =
treatment.=0D<br>=0D<br>After the incident, Chu Se Medical Center also sent=
 people to monitor,<br>investigate, verify, grasp the situation and inform =
the villagers<br>about the poisoning incident.=0D<br>=0D<br>Why does eating=
 toad meat cause poisoning?=0D<br>-----------------------------------------=
-=0D<br>According to the Department of Food Safety (Ministry of Health), fo=
r a<br>long time, people have considered toad meat as a nutritious food for=
<br>the elderly, supporting the treatment of children who are lazy to eat<b=
r>and slow to grow in the form of shrimp paste, powder or fresh meat<br>use=
d for cooking, cook porridge, and make toad rolls.=0D<br>=0D<br>However, sc=
ience has proven the subcutaneous glands, glands behind the<br>ears, glands=
 above the eyes, eggs and liver of toads contain toxins<br>such as Bufotali=
n, Bufotenin, and Bufotonin [All of these are<br>classified as Bufadienolid=
es]. Therefore, if during processing, these<br>substances remain on toad me=
at, they will cause poisoning, which is<br>very dangerous.=0D<br>=0D<br>In =
Dan Tri newspaper, Dr. Ha Thi Bich Van (Head of Emergency<br>Department, Ph=
u Tho Provincial General Hospital) warned: "The liver,<br>eggs, skin, pus, =
eyes and nerve ganglia of toads contain a lot of<br>substances. toxic, espe=
cially bufotoxin. This is an extremely toxic,<br>heat-stable substance whic=
h can cause cardiac arrhythmia and death in<br>a very short time.=0D<br>=0D=
<br>"The toxins in toads are absorbed through the digestive tract.<br>There=
fore, about 1-2 hours after eating, the patient will have the 1st<br>sympto=
ms such as bloating, abdominal pain above the navel accompanied<br>by sever=
e vomiting, possibly diarrhea.=0D<br>=0D<br>"After that, the victim has add=
itional symptoms such as dizziness,<br>hallucinations, cold sweat, increase=
d salivation, may have difficulty<br>breathing, apnea, cardiac arrest and o=
ther symptoms.=0D<br>=0D<br>"Although the meat and fat of the toad are not =
poisonous, if you are<br>not careful while processing it, toxins from other=
 parts can still<br>stick to it. The prognosis of meat and toad egg poisoni=
ng is very<br>severe, the risk of death is very high," said Dr. Ha Thi Bich=
 Van.=0D<br>=0D<br>Dr. Nguyen Trung Nguyen (Director of the Poison Control =
Center)<br>commented that during the process of processing toads, it is ver=
y easy<br>to cause the toad's venom glands to rupture. This because the toa=
d's<br>poison contained in the toad's sap (a milky white secretion) is<br>"=
crowded" in the subcutaneous and parotid glands.=20=0D<br>=0D<br>It is the =
reason many cases of toad meat poisoning occur even though<br>all skin, int=
ernal organs, and toad eggs have been removed. There are<br>components in t=
oad venom which are very toxic to the nervous system<br>and especially the =
heart. The mortality rate of this type of poisoning<br>is very high, with s=
ome patients dying right at home or on the way to<br>the hospital.=0D<br>=0D=
<br>"Toxins can easily stick to the meat area, and when eaten, poisoning<br=
>still occurs as usual," Dr. Nguyen said. Three children died due<br>eating=
 food which many parents made to nourish their children.=0D<br>=0D<br>Eatin=
g toad meat is very dangerous.=0D<br>=0D<br>Symptoms of toad meat poisoning=0D=
<br>-------------------------------=0D<br>The toad's secreted mucus can cau=
se burning and swelling in sensitive<br>areas such as the eyes, mouth, etc.=0D=
<br>=0D<br>This toxin is absorbed very quickly through the digestive tract,=
<br>poisoning symptoms usually occur about 1 hour after eating, or 15-30<br=
>minutes earlier.=0D<br>=0D<br>Initially, the victim will feel dizzy and ha=
ve stinging pain in the<br>fingertips and toes. Next is prolonged severe vo=
miting, diarrhea,<br>abdominal pain, and decreased blood pressure.=0D<br>=0D=
<br>Then symptoms similar to heart failure such as arrhythmia appear and<br=
>become more severe, then death within a few hours.=0D<br>=0D<br>How to tre=
at toad meat poisoning=0D<br>--------------------------------=0D<br>People =
who are poisoned when eating toad meat have a very high death<br>rate becau=
se of the toxins in the toad. Therefore, it is necessary to<br>detect early=
 and implement timely first aid and emergency measures at<br>medical center=
s.=0D<br>=0D<br>In case the patient shows early signs of poisoning and is s=
till<br>conscious: Actively induce vomiting and immediately take the patien=
t<br>to emergency facilities.=0D<br>=0D<br>How to eat toad meat to avoid po=
isoning?=0D<br>----------------------------------------=0D<br>According to =
medical experts, to avoid food poisoning from eating toad<br>meat, people s=
hould only use processed toad meat products in the form<br>of food and medi=
cine having allowed for circulation by the<br>authorities.=0D<br>=0D<br>Do =
not use purple toads (toads with red eyes) for eating. Only use<br>meat and=
 bones to process into food and prepare toad meat according to<br>the corre=
ct process (cut off the lower end of the two parotid glands,<br>cut off 4 f=
eet, peel the skin in a water basin, cut out the anus,<br>remove all intest=
ines, eggs, liver, bile, rinse several times under<br>clean water).=0D<br>=0D=
<br>--=0D<br>Communicated by:=0D<br>ProMED<br><br>[Toxic principles in many=
 toads are the bufadienolides, a chemical<br>compound with steroid structur=
e. Its derivatives are collectively<br>known as bufadienolides, including m=
any in the form of bufadienolide<br>glycosides. These are a type of cardiac=
 glycoside, the other being the<br>cardenolide glycosides. They can be dead=
ly, as was the case for these<br>children.=20=0D<br>=0D<br>This is a tragic=
 story, and a huge warning regarding toad meat. This<br>toad is not just lo=
cated in Viet Nam, but throughout the world.=20=0D<br>=0D<br>While this a t=
ragic story, it provides a warning to travelers, hikers,<br>explorers, and =
other groups of outdoor enthusiasts to be aware of<br>potential harm when c=
onsuming certain things on the trail.=0D<br>=0D<br>The toxic substances fou=

me dogs demonstrate an increase<br>in breathing rate, anxiety, and vomiting=
 and/or diarrhea.=0D<br>=0D<br>These signs occur within minutes after expos=

s well as an increased<br>or decreased heart rate and increased body temper=
ature.=0D<br>=0D<br>As time progresses, the clinical signs can become more =
severe, leading<br>to seizures, collapse, and severely irregular heart rhyt=
hms, and<br>eventually death. The time may be quite short, as this article<=
br>suggests. Factors affecting the timing may be the size and health of<br>=
the victim encountering the toad. Smaller and/or older animals, or<br>those=
 with other health problems, such as heart conditions, may<br>succumb to th=
e toxin much quicker.=0D<br>=0D<br>Toad toxicity is primarily diagnosed by =
history of contact with a toad<br>and physical examination. There are no te=
sts available to confirm<br>absorption of toad toxins; however, general blo=
od work, radiographs<br>(X-rays), and electrocardiograms are helpful in det=
