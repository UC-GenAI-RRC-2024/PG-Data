NCT03725722,"Dose-ranging Trial to Evaluate Delgocitinib Cream 1, 3, 8, and 20 mg/g Compared to Delgocitinib Cream Vehicle Over an 8-week Treatment Period in Adult Subjects With Atopic Dermatitis.",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03725722,,COMPLETED,"This is a double-blind, multi-centre, randomised, 5-arm, vehicle-controlled, parallel-group trial. The trial is designed to establish a dose-response signal and investigate the efficacy and safety of delgocitinib cream in the treatment of adult subjects with mild to severe atopic dermatitis (AD).",YES,Atopic Dermatitis,DRUG: Delgocitinib cream|DRUG: Delgocitinib cream vehicle,"Change From Baseline (Week 0) to Week 8 in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) Score., EASI is a validated measure used in clinical practice and clinical trials to assess the severity and extent of AD. The EASI is a composite index with scores ranging from 0 to 72, with higher values indicating more severe or more extensive condition.

The multiple comparison procedure - modelling (MCP-Mod) approach was used to guide dose selection. Mixed Model for Repeated Measurements (MMRM) analysis was used to determine the difference in the continuous endpoint between the active delgocitinib doses and delgocitinib cream vehicle., Week 0 to Week 8","Validated Investigator Global Assessment Scale for Atopic Dermatitis (vIGA-AD) Score of 0 (Clear) or 1 (Almost Clear) With ≥2-step Improvement (vIGA-AD TS) From Baseline to Week 8., vIGA-AD is an instrument used in clinical trials to assess the subject's global disease severity and is based on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (clear) to 4 (severe).

The multiple comparison procedure - modelling (MCP-Mod) approach was used to guide dose-selection. Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel analysis was used to determine the difference in response rates between the active delgocitinib cream doses and the delgocitinib cream vehicle., Week 0 to Week 8|EASI75 at Week 8, EASI75 is defined as at least 75% reduction in EASI from baseline., Week 0 to Week 8|Time to vIGA-AD TS, The time to vIGA-AD TS response is defined as the time from baseline to first assessment of a vIGA-AD score of 0 (Clear) or 1 (Almost Clear) with ≥2-step improvement, Week 0 to Week 8",,LEO Pharma,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE2,251,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: DOUBLE (PARTICIPANT, INVESTIGATOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",LP0133-1275,2018-12-28,2020-05-19,2020-05-19,2018-10-31,2021-05-07,2021-07-08,"Leo Pharma Investigational Site, Birmingham, Alabama, 35209, United States|Leo Pharma Investigational Site, Encino, California, 91436, United States|Leo Pharma Investigational Site, Los Angeles, California, 90033, United States|Leo Pharma Investigational Site, Los Angeles, California, 90045, United States|Leo Pharma Investigational Site, Rolling Hills Estates, California, 90274-7604, United States|Leo Pharma Investigational Site, Santa Ana, California, 92701, United States|Leo Pharma Investigational Site, Chicago, Illinois, 60611, United States|Leo Pharma Investigational Site, Detroit, Michigan, 48202, United States|Leo Pharma Investigational Site, New York, New York, 10019, United States|Leo Pharma Investigational Site, High Point, North Carolina, 27262, United States|Leo Pharma Investigational Site, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, 19104, United States|Leo Pharma Investigational Site, Carlton, 3053, Australia|Leo Pharma Investigational Site, Darlinghurst, 2010, Australia|Leo Pharma Investigational Site, East Melbourne, 3002, Australia|Leo Pharma Investigational Site, Hectorville, 5073, Australia|Leo Pharma Investigational Site 1, Kogarah, 2217, Australia|Leo Pharma Investigational Site, Kogarah, 2217, Australia|Leo Pharma Investigational Site, Woolloongabba, 4102, Australia|Leo Pharma Investigational Site, Calgary, Alberta, T3A 2N1, Canada|Leo Pharma Investigational Site, Edmonton, Alberta, T5K 1X3, Canada|Leo Pharma Investigational Site, Surrey, British Columbia, V3R 6A7, Canada|Leo Pharma Investigational Site, Winnipeg, Manitoba, R3M 3Z4, Canada|Leo Pharma Investigational Site, Fredericton, New Brunswick, E3B 1G9, Canada|Leo Pharma Investigational Site, Mississauga, Ontaria, L5H 1G9, Canada|Leo Pharma Investigational Site, Barrie, Ontario, L4M 7G1, Canada|Leo Pharma Investigational Site, Markham, Ontario, L3P 1X2, Canada|Leo Pharma Investigational Site, Peterborough, Ontario, K9J 5K2, Canada|Leo Pharma Investigational Site, Richmond Hill, Ontario, L4C 9M7, Canada|Leo Pharma Investigational Site, Toronto, Ontario, M2M 4J5, Canada|Leo Pharma Investigational Site, Toronto, Ontario, M2W 2N2, Canada|Leo Pharma Investigational Site, Toronto, Ontario, M3H 5Y8, Canada","Study Protocol and Statistical Analysis Plan, https://storage.googleapis.com/ctgov2-large-docs/22/NCT03725722/Prot_SAP_000.pdf"
