NCT00671528,Safety and Efficacy of Quadriderme® in the Treatment of Impetiginous Eczema (Study P05134AM4),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00671528,,TERMINATED,"This is a parallel-group, randomized, active-controlled, double-blind, Phase 4 trial comparing three creams in the treatment of impetiginous eczema:

* Arm A: QUADRIDERME® cream (betamethasone diproprionate, clotrimazole, and gentamicin sulfate)
* Arm B: Combination of betamethasone diproprionate cream and gentamicin sulfate cream
* Arm C: Betamethasone diproprionate cream

At 7 sites, in Portugal, a total of 207 subjects will be randomized using a 1:1:1 randomization ratio to receive one of the three possible treatments for a maximum period of 28 days or until 5 days after total remission of the signs and symptoms, but never more than 28 days. Assessments will be made of level of improvement of the target area in each treatment group, number of days for total remission, and safety profile.

Note: This study was terminated early due to lack of recruitment (only 3 of the 207 planned participants were enrolled). Statistical analyses were not performed.

Further, 7 sites were planned, but only 4 sites were approved out of which 3 sites were initiated.",YES,"Dermatitis, Atopic|Eczema, Atopic|Skin Diseases, Eczematous","DRUG: Cream (betamethasone diproprionate, clotrimazole, and gentamicin sulfate)|DRUG: Cream (betamethasone diproprionate and gentamicin)|DRUG: Cream (betamethasone diproprionate)","Percent Improvement of Individually Measured Signs of the Disease, Percent improvement of individually measured signs of the disease (erythema, vesiculation, scaling, pruritis) in a given target area that was chosen by the investigator was assessed objectively \& quantified on a scale of 0-5 (0-absent, 5-very intense). Overall assessment reflected the changes in the disease \& was carried out by the investigator.

The following scale was used:
