NCT01299610,A Study to Test the Effect of 2 Different Doses of Topical GW870086X on Atopic Dermatitis Also Including a Postive Control and a Placebo,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01299610,,COMPLETED,"This study is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to assess the efficacy of GW870086X cream formulation in subjects with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. Subjects will be assigned to take 3 out of the 4 possible treatments for 21 ±2 days: GW870086X 0.2% cream, GW870086X 2% cream, FP 0.05% cream (as a positive control) and placebo cream. All subjects will be randomised to receive placebo cream. Three index lesions located on the arms and/or legs (one on each) will be identified per subject and each treatment will be applied to the same lesion.",YES,"Dermatitis, Atopic",DRUG: GW870086 2.0%|DRUG: GW870086 0.2%|DRUG: FP 0.05%|DRUG: Placebo,"Change From Baseline Three Item Severity (TIS) Scores Between GW870086 (0.2% and 2%) Versus Placebo at Day 22, Three target lesions were selected and each of the 3 target lesions were assessed separately using the TIS for erythema, oedema/papulation, and excoriation using a score of 0 - 3 as 0 = absent, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe. Each participant had at least 3 index lesions (=\> 1square centimeter in size) with a sum score of =\>4 and =\< 6 for erythema, oedema/populations and excoriations using the TIS rating scale at screening. The index lesions represented common lesions i.e. not the most or least severe lesions. The total TIS score for a lesion was calculated as the sum of each of the component scores i.e. ranging from 0 (no symptoms) to 9 (severe symptoms). The values of Day 1 assessments were considered as Baseline values. The change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline TIS score from Day 22 TIS score., Baseline (Day 1) and Day 22","Change From Baseline TIS Scores Between GW870086X (0.2% and 2%) Versus Placebo on Days 2, 3, 7 and 14, Three target lesions were selected and each of the 3 target lesions were assessed separately using the TIS for erythema, oedema/papulation, and excoriation using a score of 0 - 3 as 0 = absent, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe.

The index lesions represented common lesions i.e. not the most or least severe lesions. The total TIS score for a lesion was calculated as the sum of each of the component scores i.e. may range from 0 (no symptoms) to 9 (severe symptoms). The values of Day 1 assessments were considered as Baseline values. The change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline TIS score from Day 22 values TIS score., Days 2, 3, 7, and 14|Number of Investigators Global Assessment (IGA) Responders on Days 2, 3, 7, 14 and 22, Three target lesions were selected and each of the 3 target lesions were assessed separately using the IGA. The IGA was carried out by a trained dermatologist and score ranged from 0 to 5. The detailed IGA scale is as: 0-Clear: No inflammatory signs of atopic dermatitis, 1- Almost clear: Just perceptible erythema and just perceptible apulation/infiltration, 2-Mild: Mild erythema and mild papulation/infiltration, 3-Moderate: Moderate erythema, and moderate papulation/infiltration, 4-Severe: Severe erythema and severe papulation/infiltration, 5-Very Severe: Very severe erythema, and very severe papulation/infiltration with oozing/crusting. The participant was considered as responder if each lesion at timepoint, IGA score reduced by 1 grade and improved from Baseline by 2 grades., Days 2, 3, 7, 14 and 22|Number of Participants With Any Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. SAE include AEs those result in death, a life-threatening AE, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal functions, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect. Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the participant and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Number of participants with AEs and SAEs were reported., Upto Day 21|Number of Participants With Abnormal Hematology and Clinical Chemistry Parameters of Potential Clinical Importance (PCI), Laboratory ranges of PCI represented as multiplier of lower limit of normal \[LLN\]; Multipliers of upper limit of normal (ULN). Laboratory ranges of PCI for white blood cell count (0.67×LLN; 1.82×ULN), neutrophil count (0.83×ULN), hemoglobin for male (1.03×ULN) and for female (1.13×ULN), hematocrit for male (1.02×ULN) for female (1.17×ULN), platelet count (0.67×LLN; 1.57), lymphocytes (0.81×LLN), albumin (0.86 ×LLN), calcium (0.91×LLN; 1.06×ULN), glucose (0.71×LLN; 1.41×ULN), potassium (0.86×LLN; 1.10×ULN), sodium (0.96×LLN; 1.03×ULN), aspartate amino transferase (\>= 2x ULN), alanine transaminase (\>=2x ULN), alkaline Phosphatase (\>=2x ULN), total bilirubin (\>=1.5x ULN).

Only those parameters for which at least one value of PCI was reported are summarized. There were no values of PCI in vital signs parameters over the course of the study., Up to Day 21|Pharmacokinetic Parameters: Maximum Observed Concentration (Cmax) of GW870086X, Cmax was planned to be determined directly from the raw concentration-time data.
