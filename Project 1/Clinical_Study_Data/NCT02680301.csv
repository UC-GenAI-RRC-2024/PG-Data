NCT02680301,Topical Steroid Formulation and Wet Wraps,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02680301,,COMPLETED,"The purpose of this study is to

1. Compare efficacy of 0.1% triamcinolone containing wet wrap as an ointment or as a cream formulation in patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis
2. The relative patient/subject acceptance and adherence will also be compared between the two wet wrap types",YES,"Dermatitis, Atopic",DRUG: 0.1% triamcinolone CREAM|DRUG: 0.1% triamcinolone OINTMENT,"Efficacy of 0.1% Triamcinolone Containing Wet Wrap as an Ointment or as a Cream Formulation in Patients With Moderate to Severe Atopic Dermatitis, Change in atopic dermatitis based on physician global assessment scale: 0=clear; 1=almost clear; 2=mild disease; 3=moderate disease; 4=severe disease; 5- very severe disease

Lower scores represent a better outcome., 3-5 days","Patient Reported Efficacy, Patient report of which topical steroid formulation was more effective, 3-5 days","Number of Patients Adhering to Treatment Protocol, Patient-reported adherence to wet-wrap protocol. Medication logs were used to evaluate adherence to the treatment protocol for both steroid formulations. Patents were determined to be adhering to the protocol if the number of wet-wraps for each study arm (cream or ointment) were the same. Because the total number of wraps varied between patients (the protocol required 1-2 wraps per day for 3-5 days), we reviewed medication logs to determine that each patient completed an equivalent number of ointment and cream wraps., 3-5 days",Seton Healthcare Family,,ALL,CHILD,PHASE4,40,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: SINGLE (INVESTIGATOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,CR-16-019,2016-03,2017-03,2018-06-01,2016-02-11,2018-06-28,2019-06-18,"Specially for Children Dermatology, Austin, Texas, 78723, United States","Study Protocol and Statistical Analysis Plan, https://storage.googleapis.com/ctgov2-large-docs/01/NCT02680301/Prot_SAP_000.pdf"
