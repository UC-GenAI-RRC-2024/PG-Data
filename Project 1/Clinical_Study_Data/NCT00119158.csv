NCT00119158,Combination Therapy for Atopic Dermatitis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00119158,,COMPLETED,"Atopic dermatitis is a chronic relapsing disease with acute flares. The standard therapy is to treat acute flares using topical medications. The two most common classes of topical medications for atopic dermatitis (AD) are topical corticosteroids and topical calcineurin inhibitors.

Pimecrolimus and topical corticosteroids exert their activity by different mechanisms, there may be a synergistic effect of the combination therapy. Therefore, a combination therapy may provide a faster resolution of severe skin lesions and consequently reduce the duration of the topical corticosteroid treatment. Another benefit of the combination therapy maybe the use of a lower potency corticosteroid to achieve the same degree of clearance.

The hypothesis of this trial is that the combination of the two agents will lead to faster clearance than the single agent of topical corticosteroids.",YES,Atopic Dermatitis,DRUG: Combination of pimecrolimus and fluticasone|DRUG: pimecrolimus,"Change From Baseline in the m-EASI (Eczema Area Severity Index) Score., Eczema Area severity index (EASI) is a composition of scores based on area of eczema involved, (0 = mild to 3 = severe) for four separate Atopic Dermatitis (AD) symptoms: erythema,infiltration ⁄population, excoriation and ichenification.

Total score 0-12, up to 15 days","The Time to Clearance of the Disease, The time to clearance of eczema measured in days, assessed up to 30 days following drug application|The Time to the First Day When m-EASI is Scored by the Investigator as 2 or Less, Time to partial clearance of the localized eczema lesion assessed by the investigator is measured in days, up to one week|The Percentage of Target Areas Reaching a l-IGA (Localized Investigator Global Assessment (l-IGA) or 0 or 1), The Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) and l-IGA were graded on a scale of 0-4 (0 = clear, 1 = almost clear, 2 = mild disease, 3 = moderate disease, 4 = severe). The percentage of eczema lesions from the total population that reach almost clear, up to 15 days|The Percentage of Target Areas Improved (i.e., Decrease in Localized Investigator Global Assessmet (l-IGA) Score From Baseline), The percentage of eczema areas that show improvement in l-IGA score.

The l-IGA were graded on a scale of 0-4 (0 = clear, 1 = almost clear, 2 = mild disease, 3 = moderate disease, 4 = severe disease)., up to 15 days|The Percentage of Target Areas Reaching a m-EASI (Modifed-Eczema Area Severity Index) Score of 2 or Less, The EASI is a measure of Atopic Dermatitis (AD) severity. A m-EASI score (0-12) was also calculated as the sum of severity (0 = mild to 3 = severe) for four separate AD symptoms: erythema, infiltration ⁄population, excoriation and lichenification.

The percentage of participants whose eczema reaches almost clear, up to one week|Change From Baseline in Patients' Self Assessment of Disease Severity (PSA) of Target Areas, The patient or caregiver assessment of eczema severity (PSA) was recorded daily in a diary using a 0-4 scale similar to that of the IGA.(0 = clear,
