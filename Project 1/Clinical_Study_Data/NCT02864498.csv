NCT02864498,Efficacy and Safety Study of Orally Administered DS107 in Moderate to Severe Atopic Dermatitis Patients,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02864498,,COMPLETED,"The purpose of this study is to determine whether orally administered DS107 (1g and 2g doses) is effective in the treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis.

Oral DS107 capsules will be administered for 8 weeks and will be compared against placebo.

The study will enroll approximately 300 subjects.",YES,Atopic Dermatitis,DRUG: DS107|DRUG: Placebo,"Proportion of Patients Achieving an Investigators Global Assessment (IGA) of 0 (Clear) or 1 (Almost Clear) and a Decrease of at Least 2 Points in IGA in Treated Population Compared to Placebo Population at Week 8., Proportion of patients achieving an IGA of 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear) and a decrease of at least 2 points in IGA in treated population compared to placebo population at Week 8. The IGA scale awards a score of 0-4 based on a 5-point severity scale from clear to severe disease (0 = clear, 1 = almost clear, 2 = mild disease, 3 = moderate disease, 4 = severe disease). IGA uses clinical characteristics of erythema, infiltration, papulation and oozing/crusting as scoring guidelines for the overall severity assessment., 8 weeks","Proportion of Patients Achieving an IGA Score of 0 (Clear) or 1 (Almost Clear) and a Decrease of at Least 2 Points in IGA in Treated Population Compared to Placebo Population From Baseline to Weeks 2, 4, 6, and 10., Proportion of patients achieving an IGA score of 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear) and a decrease of at least 2 points in IGA in treated population compared to placebo population from Baseline to Weeks 2, 4, 6, and 10. The IGA scale awards a score of 0-4 based on a 5-point severity scale from clear to severe disease (0 = clear, 1 = almost clear, 2 = mild disease, 3 = moderate disease, 4 = severe disease).

The IGA scale awards a score of 0-4 based on a 5-point severity scale from clear to severe disease (0 = clear, 1 = almost clear, 2 = mild disease, 3 = moderate disease, 4 = severe disease). IGA uses clinical characteristics of erythema, infiltration, papulation and oozing/crusting as scoring guidelines for the overall severity assessment., Baseline, Week 2, Week 4, Week 6, Week 8 and Week 10|Change From Baseline in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) in Treated Population Compared to Placebo Population at Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10, Change from Baseline in EASI in treated population compared to placebo population at Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10. It quantifies the severity of a patient's AD based on both lesion severity and the percent of Body Surface Area (BSA) affected. The EASI is a composite score ranging from 0-72 that takes into account the degree of erythema, induration/papulation, excoriation, and lichenification (each scored from 0 to 3 separately, half points are permitted) for each of four body regions, with adjustment for the percent of BSA involved for each body region and for the proportion of the body region to the whole body. The subscales used are summed in order to give a final EASI score. A decrease in EASI score represents a positive outcome for the patient., Baseline, Week 2, Week 4, Week 6, Week 8 and Week 10|Change From Baseline in Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) for Pruritus in Treated Population Compared to Placebo Population at Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10, Change from Baseline in Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) for pruritus in treated population compared to placebo population at Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10. Severity of pruritus related to AD will be self-assessed by patients daily using the NRS. Patients were asked to estimate the intensity of pruritus at its worst over the previous 24 hours. The Pruritus NRS is a single-question assessment tool that will be used to assess the patient's worst itch as a result of AD in the previous 24 hours. Patients scored their pruritus due to AD on a scale of 0 - 10, with 0 (no itch) and 10 (worst itch imaginable). Patients will complete the rating scale at screening and then daily starting at baseline through to the last study visit. A decrease in NRS represents a positive outcome for the patient., Baseline, Week 2, Week 4, Week 6, Week 8 and Week 10",,DS Biopharma,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE2,321,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: DOUBLE (PARTICIPANT, INVESTIGATOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",DS107G-03,2017-01,2018-06,2018-06,2016-08-12,2022-08-02,2022-10-10,"DS Biopharma Site, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States|DS Biopharma Site, Cape Town, South Africa","Study Protocol, https://storage.googleapis.com/ctgov2-large-docs/98/NCT02864498/Prot_000.pdf|Statistical Analysis Plan, https://storage.googleapis.com/ctgov2-large-docs/98/NCT02864498/SAP_001.pdf"
