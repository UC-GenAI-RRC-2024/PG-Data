NCT02925793,Safety and Efficacy Study of Topically Applied DS107 Cream in Mild to Moderate Atopic Dermatitis Patients (AD),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02925793,,COMPLETED,"The purpose of this randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, parallel group study is to compare the safety and efficacy of topically applied DS107 cream (1% and 5%) versus vehicle cream, in the treatment of adult patients with mild to moderate Atopic Dermatitis (AD).",YES,Atopic Dermatitis,DRUG: DS107|OTHER: Vehicle cream,"Change From Baseline in Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) for Pruritus in Treated Population Compared to Vehicle Population at Week 8, Change from baseline in Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) for Pruritus in treated population compared to vehicle population at Week 8. Severity of pruritus related to atopic dermatitis (AD) was self-assessed by patients daily using the NRS. Patients were asked to estimate the intensity of pruritus at its worst over the previous 24 hours. The Pruritus NRS is a single-question assessment tool that was used to assess the patient's worst itch as a result of AD in the previous 24 hours. Patients scored their pruritus due to AD on a scale of 0 - 10, with 0 indicating no itch and 10 indicating the worst itch imaginable. Patients were required to complete the rating scale daily starting at screening through to the last study visit. A decrease in worst itch NRS indicates a positive outcome for the participant., Baseline and Week 8|Change From Baseline in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) in Treated Population Compared to Vehicle Population at Week 8, Change from baseline in EASI in treated population compared to vehicle population at Week 8. EASI quantifies the severity of a patient's atopic dermatitis (AD) based on both lesion severity and the percent of body surface area (BSA) affected. The EASI is a composite score ranging from 0-72 that takes into account the degree of erythema, induration/papulation, excoriation, and lichenification (each scored from 0 to 3 separately, half points are permitted) for each of four body regions, with adjustment for the percent of BSA involved for each body region and for the proportion of the body region to the whole body. The severity of each sign is assessed using a 4-point scale (half points are permitted):

* 0 = none
* 1 = mild
* 2 = moderate
* 3 = severe A decrease in EASI indicates a positive outcome for the participant., Baseline and Week 8","Change From Baseline in NRS for Pruritus Intreated Populations Compared to Vehicle Population at Week 2, 4, 6, 10, Change from baseline in NRS for Pruritus in the treated populations compared to vehicle population at Weeks 2, 4, 6, 10. Severity of pruritus related to atopic dermatitis (AD) was self-assessed by patients daily using the NRS. Patients were asked to estimate the intensity of pruritus at its worst over the previous 24 hours. The Pruritus NRS is a single-question assessment tool that was used to assess the patient's worst itch as a result of AD in the previous 24 hours. Patients will score their pruritus due to AD on a scale of 0 - 10, with 0 indicating no itch and 10 indicating the worst itch imaginable. Patients were asked to complete the rating scale daily starting at screening through to the last study visit. A decrease in worst itch NRS indicates a positive outcome for the participant., Baseline, Week 2, Week 6 and Week 10|Proportion of Patients Achieving a Decrease of at Least 2.7 Points in NRS in the Treated Populations Compared to Vehicle Population From Baseline to Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10., • Proportion of Patients Achieving a Decrease of at Least 2.7 Points in Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) in Treated Population Compared to Vehicle Population from Baseline to Week 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10. The NRS for Pruritus is a single-question assessment tool that was used to assess the patient's worst itch as a result of AD in the previous 24 hours.

The IGA scale awards a score of 0˗4 based on a 5-point severity scale from clear to severe disease (0 = clear, 1 = almost clear, 2 = mild disease, 3 = moderate disease, 4 = severe disease). IGA uses clinical characteristics of erythema, infiltration, papulation, and oozing/crusting as scoring guidelines for the overall severity assessment., 10 weeks|Change From Baseline in IGA Score in the Treated Populations Compared to Vehicle Population at Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10., The Global Investigator Assessment scale (IGA) scale awards a score of 0-4 based on a 5-point severity scale from clear to severe disease (0 = clear, 1 = almost clear, 2 = mild disease, 3
