NCT03630198,Pain Outcomes Following Intralesional Corticosteroid Injections,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03630198,,COMPLETED,"Corticosteroid therapy, including intralesional and topical applications, has many indications within the fields of Dermatology, Plastic Surgery, and Orthopedics. However, these injections can be quite painful, which leads many patients to discontinue treatment.

Often, the injection involves a mixture of local anesthetic and corticosteroids despite a lack of evidence that the use of lidocaine improves pain. Due to the acidic pH, the lidocaine component of the injection can actually cause a significant burning sensation during the procedure. Lidocaine does not have anti-inflammatory properties and does not treat the underlying pathology. By including another medication, lidocaine also adds cost and risk to the procedure.

The purpose of this study is to see if removing lidocaine from intralesional injections decreases the pain of injection.",YES,Keloid|Alopecia Areata|Acne|Hypertrophic Scar|Epidermal Inclusion Cyst|Frontal Fibrosing Alopecia|Lichen Plano-Pilaris|Keratoacanthoma|Plaque Psoriasis|Lichen Simplex Chronicus|Prurigo Nodularis|Nummular Eczema|Granuloma Annulare|Morphea|Lichen Planus,DRUG: Corticosteroid with lidocaine|DRUG: Corticosteroid with normal saline,"Pain Outcome: Visual Analog Scale, Assessed using the visual analog scale (0-10 scale).
