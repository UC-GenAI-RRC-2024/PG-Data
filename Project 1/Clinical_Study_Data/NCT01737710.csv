NCT01737710,Atopic Dermatitis Research Network (ADRN) Influenza Vaccine Study,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01737710,,COMPLETED,"Atopic dermatitis, also called eczema, is a disease in which the skin is dry and scaly with severe itching. People who have atopic dermatitis often have complications from skin infections; these can include eczema herpeticum after herpes simplex virus infection or eczema vaccinatum after smallpox vaccination. People with atopic dermatitis may suffer from skin infections and may therefore respond differently to vaccinations.

A new flu vaccine which is injected into the skin instead of into muscle has recently been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for vaccination of the general population including patients with atopic dermatitis. This new vaccine has been shown to work as well as the vaccine which is injected into muscle when tested in people without atopic dermatitis. The main purpose of this study is to compare how people with atopic dermatitis respond to this new flu vaccine compared to non-atopic volunteers without atopic dermatitis. The second purpose is to look at how people with atopic dermatitis respond to the new vaccine which is injected into the skin compared to the vaccine which is injected into muscle.",YES,"Dermatitis, Atopic",BIOLOGICAL: Fluzone® Intradermal Vaccine|BIOLOGICAL: Fluzone® (Intramuscular) vaccine,"Seroprotection, Non-Atopic Dermatitis (AD), Intradermal vs. Moderate to Severe Atopic Dermatitis, Intradermal - Influenza B, The difference in the percent of participants that achieved seroprotection against influenza B at Day 28 between non-AD and moderate to severe AD participants, following a single dose (0.1mL) of the seasonal 2012 - 2013 Fluzone Intradermal vaccine. Seroprotection is defined as having a serum hemagglutination-inhibition (HAI) antibody titer of 1:40 or greater, which represents a sufficient antibody amount to avoid disease in half of the individuals infected with influenza B. Participants who achieved seroprotection prior to vaccination were excluded from the analysis. The goal was to examine whether there was a difference between the two groups in the percent of participants who achieved seroprotection at Day 28 who were not seroprotected prior to vaccination., Day 28 post vaccination|Seroprotection, Non-Atopic Dermatitis (AD), Intradermal vs. Moderate to Severe Atopic Dermatitis, Intradermal - Influenza H1N1, The difference in the percentage of participants that achieved seroprotection against influenza H1N1 at Day 28 between non-AD and moderate to severe AD participants, following a single dose (0.1mL) of the seasonal 2012 - 2013 Fluzone Intradermal vaccine. Seroprotection is defined as having a serum hemagglutination-inhibition (HAI) antibody titer of 1:40 or greater, which represents a sufficient antibody amount to avoid disease in half of the individuals infected with influenza H1N1.

A fold-difference of greater than 1 indicated an increase in HAI antibody titers against influenza B as a result of vaccination; therefore, higher numbers indicate a greater probability of avoiding disease if infected with influenza B.
