NCT03916081,Safety and Efficacy of ARQ-151 Cream in Adolescents and Adults With Atopic Dermatitis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03916081,,COMPLETED,"The study will assess the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and efficacy of different doses of roflumilast (ARQ-151) cream (0.05% and 0.15%) vs placebo applied once daily (QD) for 28 days by adolescents and adults with atopic dermatitis.",YES,Atopic Dermatitis,DRUG: Roflumilast Cream 0.05%|DRUG: Roflumilast Cream 0.15%|DRUG: Vehicle Cream,"Mean Change From Baseline in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) Total Score at Week 4, The least squares (LS) mean (SD) change from baseline in EASI Total Score at Week 4 is reported. The EASI is an instrument to measure the severity and extent of AD. The body is first divided into 4 areas: head (10% of skin), arms (20%), trunk (30%), and legs (40%). Then, the area affected is scored from 0 (0% involvement) to 6 (90-100% involvement), and severity is scored from 0 ('none') to 3 ('severe'). The EASI combines the area affected and severity ratings to get a final composite score ranging from 0 (no disease) to 72 (maximal disease). Note that palms and soles were treated as appropriate but were not counted towards any measurements of EASI., Baseline and Week 4","Percentage Change From Baseline in EASI Total Score, The LS mean (SD) percentage change from baseline in EASI Total Score at Weeks 1, 2, and 4 is reported.

The EASI is an instrument to measure the severity and extent of AD. The body is first divided into 4 areas: head (10% of skin), arms (20%), trunk (30%), and legs (40%). Then, the area affected is scored from 0 (0% involvement) to 6 (90-100% involvement), and severity is scored from 0 ('none') to 3 ('severe'). The EASI combines the area affected and severity ratings to get a final composite score ranging from 0 (no disease) to 72 (maximal disease), with positive results indicating an increase from baseline in EASI total score (i.e., increased symptoms) and negative results indicating a decrease from baseline score (i.e., decreased symptoms). Note that palms and soles were treated as appropriate but were not counted towards any measurements of EASI., Baseline and Weeks 1, 2, and 4|Number of Participants Achieving a 75% Decrease From Baseline in EASI Score (EASI-75), The number of participants with a decrease of at least 75% from the baseline EASI total score is presented. The EASI is an instrument to measure the severity and extent of AD. The body is first divided into 4 areas: head (10% of skin), arms (20%), trunk (30%), and legs (40%). Then, the area affected is scored from 0 (0% involvement) to 6 (90-100% involvement), and severity is scored from 0 ('none') to 3 ('severe'). The EASI combines the area affected and severity ratings to get a final composite score ranging from 0 (no disease) to 72 (maximal disease), with positive results indicating an increase from baseline in EASI total score (i.e., increased symptoms) and negative results indicating a decrease from baseline score (i.e., decreased symptoms). Note that palms and soles were treated as appropriate but were not counted towards any measurements of EASI., Baseline and Weeks 1, 2, and 4|Number of Participants Achieving a 90% Decrease From Baseline in EASI Score (EASI-90), The number of participants with a decrease of at least 90% from the baseline EASI total score is presented.

Note that palms and soles were treated as appropriate but were not counted towards any measurements of EASI. In some instances, it was not possible to compare roflumilast to vehicle due to low number of cases., Baseline and Weeks 1, 2, and 4|Number of Participants Achieving a 100% Decrease From Baseline in EASI Score (EASI-100), The number of participants with a decrease of 100% from the baseline EASI total score is presented.

The BSA affected by AD was determined by the subject's hand method, where the subject's hand (including fingers) surface area was assumed to equal 1% of BSA. Negative scores indicate improvement of symptoms, whereas positive scores indicate worsening., Baseline and Weeks 1, 2, and 4|Worse Itch Numerical Rating Score (WI-NRS) Score Change, The LS mean (SE) change from baseline in WI-NRS score is presented. The WI-NRS is a simple, single item scale to assess the subject-reported severity of this symptom, on a scale ranging from 0 (""no itch"") to 10 (""worst imaginable itch"") the subject experienced in the previous 24 hours. Higher scores indicate greater symptom severity., Baseline and Weeks 1, 2, and 4|Number of Participants Achieving ≥4-Point Improvement in WI-NRS Pruritus Score, The number of participants achieving a ≥4-point improvement from Baseline in WI-NRS score is presented. The WI-NRS is a simple, single item scale to assess the subject-reported severity of this symptom, on a scale ranging from 0 (""no itch"") to 10 (""worst imaginable itch"") the subject experienced in the previous 24 hours.
