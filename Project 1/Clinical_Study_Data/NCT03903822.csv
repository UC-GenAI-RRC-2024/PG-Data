Participants at specified time points were asked the following question: ""How would you rate your itch due to AD at the worst moment during the previous 24 hours?"" The scale ranged from 0-10, where 0= no itch and 10= worst itch imaginable.

Scalp, palms and soles were excluded. BSA was calculated using handprint method. Number of handprints (size of participant's full palmer hand) fitting in the affected area of a body region was estimated. Maximum number of handprints were 10 for head and neck, 20 for upper limbs, 30 for trunk and 40 for lower limbs. Surface area of body region equivalent to 1 handprint: 1 handprint was equal to 10% for head and neck, 5% for upper limbs, 3.33% for trunk and 2.5% for lower limbs.
