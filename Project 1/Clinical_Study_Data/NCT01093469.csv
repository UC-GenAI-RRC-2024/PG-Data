NCT01093469,Comparing Aquaphor to Atopiclair and EpiCeram in Children With Mild to Moderate Atopic Dermatitis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01093469,,COMPLETED,"The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy and cost effectiveness of Aquaphor Healing Ointment, Atopiclair and EpiCeram as a monotherapy in mild to moderate AD.

The investigators hypothesize that no statistical difference will exist in the efficacy between an over-the-counter moisturizer, Aquaphor Healing Ointment, compared to prescription devices Atopiclair and EpiCeram in treating mild to moderate AD.
