Evaluations were scored using a 5-point scale from clear (0) to severe (4), with higher numbers indicating worse scores., Baseline to Week 6","Percentage of Participants Who Had at Least a 2-grade Reduction From Baseline in the Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) Scale and Had an IGA That Equated to ""Clear"" or ""Almost Clear"", Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) was determined based on evaluator-blinded evaluations of the inflammatory signs of atopic dermatitis. Evaluations were scored using a 5-point scale from clear (0) to severe (4), with higher numbers indicating worse scores., Baseline to Week 10|Percentage of Participants Who Had Eczema Area Severity Index (EASI) 75, EASI 75 is defined as at least a 75% reduction in the Eczema Area Severity Index (EASI) score from Baseline. EASI is composite score based on the evaluated severity of 4 key signs of AD (i.e., erythema, infiltration/papulation, excoriation and lichenification), and the extent of disease in each of the 4 body regions (i.e., head/neck, trunk, upper limbs, and lower limbs). The area of involvement (affected by inflammation, not including dry skin) of each of the 4 body regions is determined and represented by a numeric coded value based on a scale from 0 to 6. The 4 body regions are assessed separately for each sign/symptom, and the average degree of severity of each sign in each of the 4 body parts is assigned a score of 0 (none) to 3 (severe) on a scale that allows half-unit increments. The EASI score ranges from 0 to 72, with higher scores being worse., Baseline to Week 10|Percentage of Participants Who Had at Least a 1 Grade Improvement From Baseline in the Severity of Pruritus Score and a Pruritus Score Equating to ""None"" or ""Mild"", Pruritis was assessed on a 4-point scale with 0 (none) to 3 (severe) and higher scores being worse., Baseline to Week 2",,"Bausch Health Americas, Inc.",,ALL,"CHILD, ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,328,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: QUADRUPLE (PARTICIPANT, CARE_PROVIDER, INVESTIGATOR, OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",V01-124A-302,2018-08-14,2020-05-12,2020-05-12,2017-02-23,2023-04-12,2023-05-08,"Valeant Site 05, Fremont, California, 94536, United States","Study Protocol and Statistical Analysis Plan, https://storage.googleapis.com/ctgov2-large-docs/83/NCT03058783/Prot_SAP_000.pdf"
