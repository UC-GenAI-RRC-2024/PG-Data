NCT03151148,Targeted Microbiome Transplant in Atopic Dermatitis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03151148,,COMPLETED,"The purpose of this study is to examine the safety and effectiveness of a new therapy, commensal lotion containing infection fighting bacteria, on decreasing or eliminating the infection causing bacteria found on the skin of Atopic Dermatitis (AD) patients.",YES,Atopic Dermatitis (AD),BIOLOGICAL: TMT Lotion|DRUG: Placebo Lotion,"Per-Participant Daily Event Rate: Serious and Non-Serious Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), Per-participant daily event rate of TEAEs was calculated as the number of events per-participant-days at risk. Statistical method employed: Poisson generalized linear model with a log link function and including the natural log of the number of days active in the study during Day 0 to Day 8., Day 0 to Day 8","The Occurrence of at Least One Serious or Non-Serious Treatment Emergent Adverse Event (TEAE), The number of participants for which at least one treatment emergent adverse event (AE), defined as an increase in grade from baseline or from the last post-baseline value that does not meet grading criteria, was reported during the measure time frame., Day 0 (after initiation of study treatment) through Day 8 (last day of study treatment)|Per-Participant Daily Event Rate of Serious and Non-Serious Adverse Events (AEs), Per-participant daily event rate of serious and non-serious AEs was calculated by the number of events per-participant days active in the study during Screening to Day 38., Screening (up to 38 days before initiation of treatment) to Day 38 (last day of study participation)|The Occurrence of at Least One Serious or Non-Serious Adverse Event (AE), The number of participants for which at least one adverse event (AE) was reported, Screening (up to 38 days before initiation of treatment) to Day 38 (last day of study participation)|The Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) Score of the Ventral Arms at Specific Days During the Measure Time Frame, The eczema area and severity index (EASI) for the ventral arms is a composite score measuring physical signs of atopic dermatitis. The scale ranges from 0-18. The components measuring severity are four signs/symptoms of atopic dermatitis: erythema, papulation, excoriation, and lichenification each scored on a scale of 0 (absent) to 3 (severe) for the ventral arms. The component measuring area is the percent area of the ventral arms with atopic dermatitis lesions scored on a scale of 0 (0%) to 6 (90-100%)., Days 0, 4, 7, 8 and 11|The Scoring Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) Score at Specific Days During the Measure Time Frame, SCORAD (Severity scoring of Atopic Dermatitis) is a composite severity index comprising A) the amount/extent of body surface area affected; A= 0-100%, B) disease intensity assessed as sum of scores for 6 parameters (erythema, edema/papulation, oozing/crusting, excoriation, lichenification, and dryness), each graded from 0 (none) to 3 (severe); B= 0-18, and C) subjective symptom visual analog assessments for pruritus \[0 (no itch) to 10 (worst imaginable itch)\] and sleep loss \[0 (no sleep loss) to 10 (worst imaginable sleep loss)\] summed for a total symptom score; C=0-20. The SCORAD = A/5 + 7B/2 + C and ranges from 0 (no AD present) to 103 (severe)., Days 0, 4, 7, 8 and 11|The Rajka-Langeland (RL) Score at Specific Days During the Measure Time Frame, The Rajka \& Langeland (RL) eczema severity score is a simple assessment of AD severity as well as the classification of AD into mild, moderate, or severe. The score is based on the grading of: (i) eczema extent based on % body area affected, (ii) eczema course based on the number of months with remission during the previous year, and (iii) eczema intensity expressed in terms of nocturnal sleep disturbance due to itch. Each parameter is scored on a scale from 1-3, and the scores are summed. The RL score ranges from 3 to 9 (mild, 3-4; moderate, 4.5-7.5; severe, 8-9), Days 0 and 7|The Pruritus Visual Analog Scale (VAS) Score of the Ventral Arms at Specific Days During the Measure Time Frame, The pruritus visual analog scale (VAS) asks participants to rate the status of their Pruritus based on the severity of their itch. Scores range from 0 to 10 (0 = no itch, 10 = worst imaginable itch), Days 0, 4, 7, 8 and 11|The Abundance of Coagulase Negative Staphylococcal (CoNS) Species, as Measured by Culture, on Lesional and Non-Lesional Skin Within Each Treatment Group, Amount of CoNS present on lesional and non-lesional skin measured by Colony Forming Units per centimeter squared (CFU/cm\^2), Days 0, 4, 7, 8 and 11|The Abundance of Coagulase Negative Staphylococcal (CoNS) Species, as Measured by qPCR (Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction), on Lesional and Non-Lesional Skin Within Each Treatment Group, Amount of CoNS on lesional and non-lesional skin measured by qPCR relative colony forming units per centimeter squared \[rCFU/cm\^2\], At days 0, 4, 7, 8 and 11|The Change From Baseline Levels of Coagulase Negative Staphylococcal (CoNS) Bacteria Abundance, as Measured by Culture, on Lesional and Non-Lesional Skin Within Each Treatment Group, Amount of CoNS present on lesional and non-lesional skin measured by Colony Forming Units per centimeter squared (CFU/cm\^2), Days 0 (1 hour post treatment), 4, 7, 8 and 11|The Change From Baseline Levels of Coagulase-Negative Staphylococcus (CoNS) Bacteria Abundance, as Measured by qPCR (Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction), on Lesional and Non-Lesional Skin Within Each Treatment Group, Amount of CoNS present on lesional and non-lesional skin measured by qPCR (relative colony forming units per centimeter squared \[rCFU/cm\^2\]), Days 0 (1 hour post treatment), 4, 7, 8 and 11|The Change From Baseline Levels of S.
