NCT04444752,A Study to Assess the Efficacy and Safety of CBP-201 in Adult Subjects With Moderate to Severe Atopic Dermatitis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04444752,,COMPLETED,"This study will evaluate the efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of CBP-201 in adult subjects with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis.",YES,Moderate-to-severe Atopic Dermatitis,DRUG: CBP-201|DRUG: placebo,"Percent Reduction in EASI Score From Baseline to Week 16, EASI=Eczema Area Severity Index is a validated physician score for signs of atopic dermatitis. EASI can range from 0 to 72. An EASI score of 0 indicates clear/no eczema, 0.1 to 1.0 almost clear, 1.1 to 7 mild disease, 7.1 to 21 moderate disease, 21.1 to 50 severe disease, and 51-72 indicates very severe disease. EASI Sub-scale ranges are as follows: Head/neck can range from 0-7.2, Trunk 0-14.4, Upper Extremities 0-21.6, Lower Extremities can range from 0-28.8. To calculate EASI, % involvement is first assessed by body region with an Area involvement Score of 0-6 for each region: 0=0%, 1=1-9%, 2=10-29%, 3=30-39%, 4=50-69%, 5=70-89%, 6=90-100% involvement. Then 4 attributes (Erythema, Edema/Papulation, Excoriation, and Lichenification) are scored for severity (0= none, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe). A multiplier is applied head/neck=0.1, trunk=0.2, upper extremities= 0.3, lower extremities=0.4. The total EASI score is the sum of 4 regional sub-scores., Reduction from baseline to 16 weeks","vIGA of 0/1 at Week 16, Validated Investigator Global Assessment Score (vIGA) is assigned by the physician based on morphologic presentation of the disease in the clinic. The physician considers extent and severity of erythema, induration/papulation, lichenification, and oozing/crusting. A vIGA Score of 0=Clear, 1=Almost Clear, 2= Mild dermatitis, 3=Moderate dermatitis, and 4= Severe dermatitis. Patients are required to have a baseline IGA of 3 or 4. The response rate or percentage of patients achieving a vIGA of 0 or 1 (improved to clear or almost clear) at week 16 is the outcome., Response Rate at 16 weeks",,"Suzhou Connect Biopharmaceuticals,
