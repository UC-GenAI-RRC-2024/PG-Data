NCT01149759,Reversal of Epidermal Phenotype in Severe Atopic Dermatitis With Cyclosporine Therapy,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01149759,,COMPLETED,"Atopic Dermatitis (AD) or eczema is a chronic relapsing inflammatory disease that affects 1-3% of the adults and up to 25% of the children in the United States. Patients with severe AD will be studied during a 24-week study with systemic cyclosporine (Neoral, capsule form) to evaluate the immune suppression and pathological correlation of cyclosporine A in these patients in order to determine the extent to which immune activation drives the pathological epidermal phenotype.",YES,Atopic Dermatitis|Eczema,DRUG: Cyclosporine A,"SCORAD Change Score, SCORAD (""SCORing Atopic Dermatitis"") is a clinical tool for assessing the severity (i.e., extent, intensity) of atopic dermatitis (AD) as objectively as possible with scores ranging from 0-100. The higher the score indicates more severe AD. For this outcome the SCORAD change score is computed as an absolute number which is comparing improvement in the SCORAD score of participants at week 12 compared to their SCORAD score at baseline., 12 weeks","Change in Epidermal Thickness, Change in lesional skin epidermal thickness at week 12 compared to baseline, 12 weeks",,Rockefeller University,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,9,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: NA|Intervention Model: SINGLE_GROUP|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,JKR-0663,2010-06,2014-12,2014-12,2010-06-23,2016-07-26,2017-03-27,"The Rockefeller University, New York, New York, 10065, United States",
