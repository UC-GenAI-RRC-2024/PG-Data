NCT04212169,Efficacy and Safety of MEDI3506 in Adult Subjects With Atopic Dermatitis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04212169,,COMPLETED,This is a research study to determine the efficacy and safety of investigational drug MEDI3506 for the treatment of adult subjects with Atopic Dermatitis.,YES,Atopic Dermatitis,DRUG: MEDI3506|DRUG: Placebo,"Percent Change From Baseline to Week 16 in EASI Score, The EASI evaluates 4 anatomic regions for severity and extent of key disease signs and focuses on the acute and chronic signs of inflammation (ie, erythema, edema, papulation, excoriation, and lichenification). The maximum score is 72, with higher values indicating more severe disease. Analysis was performed using mixed effect model for repeated measures and MCP-mod dose response model., Week 16","Percentage of Subjects Achieving a 90% Reduction From Baseline in EASI Score at Week 16, To further assess the effects of MEDI3506 compared with placebo on AD disease severity, in adult subjects with moderate-to-severe AD. Responders are subjects who achieved at least 90% reduction from baseline in EASI score., Week 16|Percentage of Subjects Achieving a 75% Reduction From Baseline in EASI Score at Week 16, To further assess the effects of MEDI3506 compared with placebo on AD disease severity, in adult subjects with moderate-to-severe AD. Responders are subjects who achieved at least 75% reduction from baseline in EASI score., Week 16|Percentage of Subjects Achieving a 50% Reduction From Baseline in EASI Score at Week 16, To further assess the effects of MEDI3506 compared with placebo on AD disease severity, in adult subjects with moderate-to-severe AD. Responders are subjects who achieved at least 50% reduction from baseline in EASI score., Week 16|Percentage of Subjects Achieving an IGA of 0 (Clear) or 1 (Almost Clear) With at Least a 2 Grade Reduction From Baseline Score at Week 16, The IGA allows investigators to assess overall AD disease severity at 1 given time point and consists of a 5-point severity scale from clear to very severe disease (0 = clear, 1 = almost clear, 2 = mild disease, 3 = moderate disease, and 4 = severe disease)., Week 16|Percentage of Subjects Achieving a Reduction of ≥ 3 From Baseline to Week 16 in Weekly Mean of Daily Peak Pruritus NRS, Peak pruritus (ie, worst itch experienced in the previous 24 hours) assessed using an Numerical Rating Scale (NRS; 0 to 10) with 0 = no itch and 10 = worst imaginable itch. The daily assessments were summarised as a weekly mean., Week 16|Change From Baseline to Week 16 in Weekly Mean of Daily Peak Pruritus NRS, Peak pruritus (ie, worst itch experienced in the previous 24 hours) assessed using an Numerical Rating Scale (NRS; 0 to 10) with 0 = no itch and 10 = worst imaginable itch. The daily assessments were summarised as a weekly mean., Week 16|Change From Baseline to Week 16 in Weekly Mean of Daily Peak Skin Pain NRS, Skin pain (ie, worst skin pain experienced in the previous 24 hours) assessed using an NRS (0 to 10) with 0 = no pain and 10 = worst imaginable pain. The daily assessments were summarised as a weekly mean., Week 16|SCORAD: Percent Change From Baseline to Week 16, SCORAD is a clinical tool for assessing the severity of AD that evaluates the extent and intensity of AD lesions, in addition to subjective symptoms. The maximum total score is 103, with higher values indicating more severe disease., Week 16|Change From Baseline to Week 16 in Percentage Body Surface Area (BSA) Affected by AD, Change in percentage of body surface area (BSA) affected by AD from baseline at week 16., Week 16|Change From Baseline to Week 16 in DLQI, The Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) is a 10-item, patient- completed, health-related quality of life assessment of dermatology conditions with a recall period of 1 week. Each item is scored on a 4-point Likert scale with 0 = not at all ⁄not relevant, 1 = a little, 2 = a lot, and 3 = very much. The score from each item is summed, and the maximum total score is 30 while the minimum score is 0. Higher score means highest (adverse) effect on participant's life., Week 16|Patient Description of Atopic Dermatitis or Eczema From Patient Global Impression of Severity at Week 16, The Patient Global Impression of Severity (PGI-S) is a tool that allows patients to rate the severity of a condition over the past 7 days with response options of ""No symptoms"", ""Very mild"", ""Mild"", ""Moderate"", ""Severe"" and ""Very severe""., Week 16|Change From Baseline to Week 16 in POEM, The Patient-Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM) is a 7-item questionnaire for assessing disease symptoms including dryness, itching, flaking, cracking, sleep loss, bleeding, and weeping occurring in the past week. Each item is scored on a 5-point scale with 0 = no days, 1 = 1 to 2 days, 2 = 3 to 4 days, 3 = 5 to 6 days, and 4 = every day. The total POEM score is calculated by summing the score of each item resulting in a maximum of 28 and a minimum of 0, with higher values indicating severe disease, Week 16|Change From Baseline to Week 16 in 5-D Itch, The 5-D Itch Scale is a questionnaire consisting of 5 items used specifically to measure the course of itch by asking for the degree, duration, disability and distribution of the pruritus within the last 2 weeks. The scores from each item are summed, with maximum score of 25 and minimum score of 5. Higher score represent worse outcome, Week 16|Occurrence of Adverse Events, To assess the safety and tolerability of MEDI3506 compared with placebo, in adult subjects with moderate-to-severe AD., up
