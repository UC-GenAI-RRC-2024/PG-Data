NCT03761537,Tralokinumab in Combination With Topical Corticosteroids in Subjects With Severe Atopic Dermatitis - ECZTRA 7,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03761537,ECZTRA 7,COMPLETED,"Primary objective:

To demonstrate that tralokinumab in combination with topical corticosteroids (TCS) is superior to placebo in combination with TCS in treating severe AD in subjects who are not adequately controlled with or have contraindications to oral cyclosporine A (CSA).

Secondary objectives:

To evaluate the efficacy of tralokinumab in combination with TCS on severity and extent of AD, itch, and health-related quality of life compared to placebo in combination with TCS.

To evaluate the safety of tralokinumab in combination with TCS when treating severe AD in subjects who are not adequately controlled with or have contraindications to oral CSA compared to placebo in combination with TCS.",YES,Atopic Dermatitis,DRUG: Tralokinumab|OTHER: Placebo,"At Least 75% Reduction in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI75) From Week 0 to Week 16, EASI (Eczema Area and Severity Index) is a validated measure used in clinical practice and clinical trials to assess the severity and extent of AD.

Each item is scored on a 4-point Likert scale (0 = not at all ∕not relevant; 1 = a little; 2 = a lot; 3 = very much). The total score is the sum of the 10 items (0 to 30); a high score is indicative of a poor HRQoL., Week 0 to Week 16|Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) Score of 0 (Clear) or 1 (Almost Clear) at Week 16, IGA is an instrument used in clinical trials to rate the severity of the subject's global AD and is based on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (clear) to 4 (severe)., Week 16|At Least 75% Reduction in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI75) From Week 0 to Week 26, EASI (Eczema Area and Severity Index) is a validated measure used in clinical practice and clinical trials to assess the severity and extent of AD.
