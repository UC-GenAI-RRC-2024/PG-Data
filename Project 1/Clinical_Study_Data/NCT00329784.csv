NCT00329784,Promoting Tolerance to Peanut in High-Risk Children,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00329784,LEAP,COMPLETED,"This study will evaluate whether early exposure to peanuts promotes tolerance and provides protection from developing peanut allergy in children who are allergic to eggs or who have severe eczema.

This study has been continued into the ITN049AD (LEAP-On) Study (NCT01366846).",YES,Eczema|Egg Allergy|Food Allergy,BIOLOGICAL: Peanut Consumption Group,"Number of Participants With Peanut Allergy at 60 Months of Age - by Skin Prick Test Stratum, At 60 months of age, participants were given an oral food challenge Participants regarded as unlikely to be allergic to peanut received 5 g of peanut protein in a single dose. These participants were considered to have a peanut allergy if they experienced any type of reaction following consumption. A double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenge was offered to other participants with a total of 9.4 g of peanut protein administered in increments. These participants were considered to have a peanut allergy if at any point during the dose escalation procedure the participant had a reaction. Participants for whom data from the oral food challenge were either inconclusive or not available, a diagnostic algorithm based on clinical history, the results of a skin-prick test, and the values for peanut-specific IgE were used to determine whether or not a participant should be considered to have peanut allergy., 60 months|Number of Participants With Peanut Allergy at 60 Months of Age - Both Strata Combined, At 60 months of age, participants were given an oral food challenge Participants regarded as unlikely to be allergic to peanut received 5 g of peanut protein in a single dose. These participants were considered to have a peanut allergy if they experienced any type of reaction following consumption. A double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenge was offered to other participants with a total of 9.4 g of peanut protein administered in increments. These participants were considered to have a peanut allergy if at any point during the dose escalation procedure the participant had a reaction. Participants for whom data from the oral food challenge were either inconclusive or not available, a diagnostic algorithm based on clinical history, the results of a skin-prick test, and the values for peanut-specific IgE were used to determine whether or not a participant should be considered to have peanut allergy., 60 months","SCORAD at 60 Months, At 60 months of age, participants were assessed for eczema using a modified Scoring Atopic Dermatitis System (SCORAD). This measure was used to detect eczema in children who may not have had access to topical anti-inflammatory medications or whose parents cannot recall or report the severity of their child's eczema. Eczema is any type of dermatitis or inflammation of the skin. Atopic dermatitis is the most severe and chronic of all types of eczema. The range of the SCORAD is 0-103. A score of 0 indicates no eczema, scores between 0 and 15 indicate mild eczema, scores between 15 and 40 indicate moderate eczema, and scores greater than 40 indicate severe eczema., 60 months|Number of Participants With Asthma at 60 Months, At 60 months of age, participants were assessed for asthma. Participants were considered to have asthma if they had a history of cough, wheeze, or shortness of breath that (1) was responsive to therapy with bronchodilators on two or more occasions in the previous 24 months, (2) required one visit to a physician in the previous 24 months, or (3) occurred during the night, during early morning, or upon exercising in the intervals between exacerbations at any time in the previous 12 months., 60 months|Number of Participants With Rhinitis at 60 Months, At 60 months of age, participants were assessed for rhinitis. Two types of rhinitis were assessed, perennial rhinoconjunctivitis and seasonal rhinoconjunctivitis. Participants were considered to have either type of rhinitis if they showed a sensitization to the allergen and clinical history of rhinoconjunctivitis symptoms experienced either when exposed to the relevant allergen (perennial) or during the relevant season (seasonal)., 60 months|Number of Participants With Specific Skin Prick Test Greater Than or Equal to 3mm, At 60 months of age, participants were assessed for potential allergy to selected food allergens. Participants were considered to have a specific sensitivity if a skin prick containing the allergen produced a wheal size measuring greater than or equal to 3 mm., 60 months|Number of Participants With Food Specific IgE Greater Than or Equal to 0.35 kU/L, At 60 months of age, participants were assessed for potential allergy to selected food allergens. Participants were considered to have a specific food sensitivity if a blood draw showed specific IgE levels greater than or equal to 0.35 kU/L for selected ingested allergens., 60 months",,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID),Immune Tolerance Network (ITN),ALL,CHILD,PHASE2,640,NIH,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,DAIT ITN032AD,2006-12,2014-05,2014-05,2006-05-25,2016-11-01,2019-04-17,"Evelina Children's Hospital, Guy's & St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust, London, England, SE1 7EH, United Kingdom",
