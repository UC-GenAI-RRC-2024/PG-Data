NCT03948334,A Study to Assess the Safety and Efficacy of ZPL389 With TCS/TCI in Atopic Dermatitis Patients,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03948334,ZESTExt,TERMINATED,This extension study (CZPL389A2203E1) was designed as a 2-year (100 weeks) extension to the core study (CZPL389A2203/ NCT03517566) which is disclosed separately. It aimed to assess the short-term and long-term safety of (blinded) 30 mg o.d and 50 mg o.d ZPL389 with concomitant or intermittent use of topical corticosteroids (TCS) and/or topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCI).,YES,Atopic Dermatitis,DRUG: ZPL389 30mg|DRUG: ZPL389 50mg|DRUG: TCS and/or TCI,"Number of Patients With Adverse Events in the First 16 Weeks of This Extension Study, An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence (e.g., any unfavorable and unintended sign \[including abnormal laboratory findings\], symptom or disease) in a subject or clinical investigation subject after providing written informed consent for participation in the study until the end of study visit. Therefore, an AE may or may not be temporally or causally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product.

As all patients were rolling over from the core study CZPL389A2203, in addition to the time frame referring to the start in this extension study, the time frame corresponding to the start in the core study (+16 weeks) are provided in parenthesis., 16 weeks (week 16 to week 32 referring to core study)|Number of Patients With Adverse Events After 16 Weeks of Treatment in This Extension Study, An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence (e.g., any unfavorable and unintended sign \[including abnormal laboratory findings\], symptom or disease) in a subject or clinical investigation subject after providing written informed consent for participation in the study until the end of study visit. Therefore, an AE may or may not be temporally or causally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product.

As all patients were rolling over from the core study CZPL389A2203, in addition to the time frame referring to the start in this extension study, the time frame corresponding to the start in the core study (+16 weeks) are provided in parenthesis., From week 16 to week 67 of this extension study (week 32 to week 83 referring to core study)","Percentage of Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) Responders Over Time, IGA score is used to determine the severity of atopic dermatitis symptoms and clinical response to treatment. The scale ranges from 0=clear to 4=severe. It is a static scale and doesn't refer to previous status of the subject. IGA response is an achievement of an IGA score of 0 or 1 with a 2-point reduction from baseline without use of confounding therapy up to the assessment time point. Treatment discontinuations for lack of efficacy or AE are considered non-responders.Presentation of the results is stratified by if patients were re-randomized from the core study or not. As all patients were rolling over from the core study, in addition to the timeframe referring to the start in this extension study, the timeframe corresponding to the start in the core study (+16 weeks) are provided in parenthesis. Percentage of responders was calculated based on a logistic regression model with response as outcome variable and treatment (dose as categorical variable) and baseline IGA as covariates., Week 4, Week 8, Week 12, Week 16, Week 28, Week 40 (Week 20, Week 24, Week 28 ,Week 32, Week 44, Week 56 referring to core study)|Percentage of EASI50 Responders Over Time, Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) is used to assess the extend and severity of atopic dermatitis on a scale from 0 to 72 where 72 is worst eczema.

EASI50 response is defined as achieving ≥ 50% improvement (reduction) in EASI score compared to baseline.

Treatment discontinuations for lack of efficacy or adverse event are considered non-responders.

Presentation of the results is stratified by if patients were re-randomized from the core study or not.

EASI75 response is defined as a reduction from baseline of ≥ 75% in EASI score. Treatment discontinuations for lack of efficacy or adverse event are considered non-responders.

Presentation of the results is stratified by if patients were re-randomized from the core study or not.
