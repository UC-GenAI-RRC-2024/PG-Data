NCT01522391,"A Randomized, Double-blinded Placebo-controlled Study to Investigate Antimicrobial Efficacy and Safety Following Topical Application of DPK-060",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01522391,,COMPLETED,"The primary objective of this study was to evaluate microbial density in eczematous lesions during two weeks of twice daily therapy with the investigational product, DPK-060 1% ointment, compared with placebo in patients with atopic dermatitis. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled part of the study was preceded with an open-label investigation in a small group of patients (n=5) treated with two applications of DPK-060 1% ointment per day for four days to assess safety, local tolerability and systemic absorption of DPK-060.

The secondary objectives were to evaluate severity of eczema and pruritus, to assess the tolerability and safety of the treatment and to assess the degree of systemic absorption of DPK-060 in blood on Day 7 and Day 21 in a sub-set of 10 patients.",YES,Atopic Dermatitis,DRUG: DPK-060 1% ointment|DRUG: Placebo for DPK-060 ointment,"Percent Change From Baseline in Total Microbial Colony Forming Units
