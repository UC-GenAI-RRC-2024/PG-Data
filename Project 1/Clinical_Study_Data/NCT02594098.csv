NCT02594098,Secukinumab for Treatment of Atopic Dermatitis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02594098,,COMPLETED,"Atopic Dermatitis, also known as atopic eczema, or eczema, is a common skin disease that can affect males and females of all ages, but often starts in childhood. Recent studies show at least 4-7% of adults and 15-25% of children to be affected, with one third of patients having severe disease. It results in very itchy, red, swollen, and cracked skin. Scratching worsens the symptoms and causes the skin to become thickened over time. Patients with atopic dermatitis have an increased risk of skin infections, and many also develop hay fever or asthma. Atopic dermatitis can cause significant distress to both patients and their families.

In this study, the aim is to assess the effects of a new treatment called secukinumab in patients with atopic dermatitis. A total of 30 patients will be included in the study, which will run for a total of 52 weeks.",YES,Atopic Dermatitis,DRUG: Secukinumab|DRUG: Placebo,"Fold-Change in Epidermal Thickness of Lesional Skin, Epidermal hyperplasia assessed using change in epidermal thickness at week 16 as compared to baseline, at Week 16","Fold-Change in K16 Expression of Lesional Skin, Epidermal hyperplasia assessed using change in the epidermal proliferation marker Ki67 at week 16 as compared to baseline. Staining quantification was performed with ImageJ 1.42, at Week 16|Number of Patients With SCORAD-50, The proportion of patients who achieve an improvement of 50% or greater from their Baseline objective SCORAD up to week 52. SCORing Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) -The intensity part of the SCORAD index consists of six items: erythema, edema⁄papulation, excoriations, lichenification, oozing⁄crusts and dryness. Each item graded on a scale 0-3. The subjective items include daily pruritus and sleeplessness, graded on a 10-cm visual analogue scale, with maximum subjective score 20. SCORAD full score is 0-103, with higher score indicating more symptoms., Week 4, Week 16, Week 32, Week 52|Number of Patients Who Achieve EASI-50 Score, The proportion of patients who achieve an improvement of 50% or greater from their Baseline EASI score up to week 52. The EASI index assigns proportionate values to 4 body regions. Each region is assigned a score of 0 to 3, indicating none, mild, moderate, and severe clinical expression. The percentage of area involved is also assigned an eruption proportional score from 0 to 6. The total body score for each body region is obtained by multiplying the sum of the severity scores by the area score, then multiplying the result by the constant weighted value assigned to that body region. The sum of these scores gives the EASI total from 0-72, with higher score indicating more severity., Week 4, Week 16, Week 32, Week 52|Number of Patients With Static Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) Score 0 or 1, The proportion of patients who achieve a score of ""clear-0"" or ""almost clear-1"" in the static IGA score at Week 16 as compared to Baseline. The static IGA score represents an overall static evaluation of dermatitis, performed by the investigator at each visit. It utilizes a scale of 6-points; total scale ranging from 0 (clear) to 5 (very severe disease)., Week 16, Week 32, Week 52|Percentage Change From Baseline in SCORAD Score, Percentage change in SCORAD scores at Week 16 as compared to baseline.
