The total EASI score ranges from 0 (minimum) to 72 (maximum) points, with the higher scores reflecting the worse severity of AD. Difference of percent change in EASI between current study baseline and week 36 in from parent study baseline (NCT02277743 and NCT02277769) was reported. Values after first rescue treatment used were set to missing before multiple imputation (MI)., Baseline (Parent Study), Baseline (Current Study) and Week 36 (Current study)|Percentage of Participants With Eczema Area and Severity Index >= 75% [EASI-75] at Baseline of Current Study Maintaining EASI-75 at Week 36, The EASI score was used to measure the severity and extent of AD and measured erythema, infiltration, excoriation and lichenification on 4 anatomic regions of the body: head, trunk, upper and lower extremities. The total EASI score ranges from 0 (minimum) to 72 (maximum) points, with the higher scores reflecting the worse severity of AD. EASI-75 responders were the participants who achieved \>=75% overall improvement in EASI score at Week 36. Values after first rescue treatment used were set to missing. Patients with missing value at week 36 were considered as a non-responder., Week 36","Percentage of Participants Maintaining Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) Response Within 1 Point of Baseline at Week 36, IGA is an assessment scale used to determine severity of AD and clinical response to treatment on a 5-point scale (0 = clear; 1 = almost clear; 2 = mild; 3 = moderate; 4 = severe) based on erythema and papulation/infiltration. Therapeutic response is an IGA score of 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear). Participants with IGA score of 0 or 1 at baseline and maintaining within 1 point of baseline were reported as responders.

Participants were asked the following question: how would a participant rate his itch at the worst moment during the previous 24 hours (for maximum itch intensity on a scale of 0 - 10 \[0 = no itch; 10 = worst itch imaginable\]). Values after first rescue treatment used were set to missing before MI., Baseline, Week 35|Absolute Change From Baseline in Body Surface Area (BSA) Through Week 36, BSA affected by AD was assessed for each section of the body (the possible highest score for each region was: head and neck \[9%\], anterior trunk \[18%\], back \[18%\], upper limbs \[18%\], lower limbs \[36%\], and genitals \[1%\]). It was reported as a percentage of all major body sections combined. Values after first rescue treatment used were set to missing (censoring) before MI., Baseline through Week 36|Absolute Change From Baseline Through in Patient Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM) Through Week 36, The POEM is a 7-item questionnaire that assesses disease symptoms (dryness, itching, flaking, cracking, sleep loss, bleeding and weeping) with a scoring system of 0 (absent disease) to 28 (severe disease) (high score indicative of poor quality of life \[QOL\]). Values after first rescue treatment used were set to missing (censoring) before MI., Baseline through Week 36|Absolute Change From Baseline in Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) Through Week 36, The DLQI is a 10-item, validated questionnaire used in clinical practice and clinical trials to assess the impact of AD disease symptoms and treatment on quality of life (QOL). The 10 questions assessed QOL over the past week, with an overall scoring of 0 (absent disease) to 30 (severe disease); a high score was indicative of a poor QOL. Values after first rescue treatment used were set to missing before MI., Baseline through Week 36|Absolute Change From Baseline in Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS) Through Week 36, HADS is a fourteen item scale. Seven of the items relate to anxiety and seven items relate to depression. Each item on the questionnaire is scored from 0 (minimum score) - 3 (maximum score) and this means that a person can score between 0 (no symptoms) and 21 (severe symptoms) for either anxiety or depression. Cut-offs for identifying psychiatric distress has been reported as 7 to 8 for possible presence, 10 to 11 for probable presence, and 14 to 15 for severe anxiety or depression.
