NCT01732510,A Study of Intravenous MK-8226 in Participants With Moderate-to-Severe Atopic Dermatitis (MK-8226-003),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01732510,,TERMINATED,"This is a 3-part study to assess the safety, tolerability, efficacy, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and immunogenicity of MK-8226 in participants with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. Part 1 (multiple rising dose study) objectives were to find the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of MK-8226 and to assess safety and PK. Part 2 objectives were to determine safety, PK, and preliminary efficacy. Part 3 objectives were to further define safety and PK, and explore MK-8226 PK/PD to model the optimal dose range for future studies. The study was terminated early due to business reasons on 08 May 2014; final results from an analysis for Part 1 (efficacy, PK, safety, immunogenicity) and Part 2 (safety, immunogenicity) are summarized.",YES,Atopic Dermatitis,DRUG: MK-8226|DRUG: Placebo,"Number of Participants Who Experienced at Least One Adverse Event, An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure. Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a preexisting condition that is temporally associated with the use of the Sponsor's product, is also an AE., Up to 32 Weeks|Number of Participants Who Discontinued Study Drug Due to an Adverse Event, An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment.

The EASI assesses intensity of four lesion characteristics (erythema, infiltration/population, excoriation, lichenification) each rated on a scale of 0 (absent) to 3 (severe) across four regions (head, trunk, upper and lower extremities). Affected areas in each region are assessed as percentage of body surface (head \[10%\], trunk \[30%\], upper extremities \[20%\], and lower extremities \[40%\]).
