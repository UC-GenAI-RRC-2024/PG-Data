The score is based on an overall assessment of the degree of erythema, papulation/induration, oozing/crusting, and lichenification., Week 16|Percentage of Participants With EASI <7 at Week 16, The EASI assesses objective physician estimates of 2 dimensions of atopic dermatitis - disease extent and clinical signs affected: 0 = 0%; 1 = 1-9%; 2 = 10-29%; 3 = 30-49%; 4 = 50-69%; 5 = 70-89%; 6 = 90-100% and the severity of 4 clinical signs: (1) erythema, (2) edema/papulation, (3) excoriation, and (4) lichenification each on a scale of 0 to 3 (0 = none, absent; 1 = mild; 2 = moderate; 3 = severe) at 4 body sites (head/neck, trunk, upper limbs, and lower limbs). Half scores are allowed between severities 1, 2, and 3. The final EASI score was obtained by weight-averaging these 4 scores and will range from 0 to 72 (severe)., Week 16|Percentage of Participants Achieving EASI50 at Week 16, The EASI assesses objective physician estimates of 2 dimensions of atopic dermatitis - disease extent and clinical signs affected: 0 = 0%; 1 = 1-9%; 2 = 10-29%; 3 = 30-49%; 4 = 50-69%; 5 = 70-89%; 6 = 90-100% and the severity of 4 clinical signs: (1) erythema, (2) edema/papulation, (3) excoriation, and (4) lichenification each on a scale of 0 to 3 (0 = none, absent; 1 = mild; 2 = moderate; 3 = severe) at 4 body sites (head/neck, trunk, upper limbs, and lower limbs). Half scores are allowed between severities 1, 2, and 3. The final EASI score was obtained by weight-averaging these 4 scores and will range from 0 to 72 (severe).

The EASI responder is defined as a participant who achieves a ≥ 50% improvement from baseline in the EASI score., Week 16|Percentage of Participants Achieving EASI90 at Week 16, The EASI assesses objective physician estimates of 2 dimensions of atopic dermatitis - disease extent and clinical signs affected: 0 = 0%; 1 = 1-9%; 2 = 10-29%; 3 = 30-49%; 4 = 50-69%; 5 = 70-89%; 6 = 90-100% and the severity of 4 clinical signs: (1) erythema, (2) edema/papulation, (3) excoriation, and (4) lichenification each on a scale of 0 to 3 (0 = none, absent; 1 = mild; 2 = moderate; 3 = severe) at 4 body sites (head/neck, trunk, upper limbs, and lower limbs). Half scores are allowed between severities 1, 2, and 3. The final EASI score was obtained by weight-averaging these 4 scores and will range from 0 to 72 (severe).

The EASI responder is defined as a participant who achieves a ≥ 90% improvement from baseline in the EASI score, Week 16|Percent Change From Baseline in the Sleep Loss Scale Score, The Sleep Loss Scale is used by the participants to report the impact of itching on their sleep every night. Participants responded to the question to what extent did your itching interfere with your sleep last night. The scale ranged from 0 to 4, with 0 (not at all) to 4 (unable to sleep at all). Higher scores indicated a greater impact and worse outcome. Assessments were recorded daily by the participant using an electronic diary.

Least Squares (LS) Means were calculated using ANCOVA with the factor of treatment and the baseline sleep-loss scale as covariates., Baseline, Week 16|Percent Change From Baseline in Pruritus Numeric Rating Score (NRS), The Pruritus NRS is an 11-point scale used by participants to assess their worst itch severity over the past 24 hours, with 0 indicating no itch and 10 indicating worst itch imaginable. Pruritus assessments were recorded daily by the participant using an electronic diary.

LS Means were calculated using ANCOVA with the factor of treatments and the baseline pruritus NRS as covariates., Baseline, Week 16|Percentage of Participants With Pruritus NRS Change of ≥3 at Week 16, The Pruritus NRS is an 11-point scale used by participants to assess their worst itch severity over the past 24 hours, with 0 indicating no itch and 10 indicating worst itch imaginable. Assessments were recorded daily by the participant using an electronic diary.

The percentage of participants who are dichotomized to success (pruritus NRS greater than or equal to 3-point improvement) at Week 16 will be analyzed using a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test., Week 16|Percentage of Participants With Pruritus NRS Change of ≥4 From Baseline to Week 16, The Pruritus NRS is an 11-point scale used by participants to assess their worst itch severity over the past 24 hours, with 0 indicating no itch and 10 indicating worst itch imaginable. Assessments were recorded daily by the participant using an electronic diary.

The percentage of participants who are dichotomized to success (pruritus NRS greater than or equal to 4-point improvement) at Week 16 will be analyzed using a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test., Week 16|Change From Baseline in Body Surface Area (BSA) Involved With Atopic Dermatitis (AD), The body surface area (BSA) affected by AD will be assessed for 4 separate body regions: head and neck, trunk (including genital region), upper extremities, and lower extremities (including the buttocks). Each body region will be assessed for disease extent ranging from 0% to 100% involvement. BSA was calculated using the participant's palm using the 1% rule, 1 palm was equivalent to 1% with estimates of the number of palms it takes to cover the affected AD area. Maximum number of palms were 10 palms for head and neck (10%), 20 palms for upper extremities (20%), 30 palms for trunk, including axilla and groin (30%), 40 palms for lower extremities, including buttocks (40%). Percent of BSA for a body region was calculated as = total number of palms in a body region \* % surface area equivalent to 1 palm. Overall percent BSA of all 4 body regions ranges from 0% to 100 % with higher values representing greater severity of AD., Baseline, Week 16|Change From Baseline in Atopic Dermatitis Impact Questionnaire (ADIQ) Score, The ADIQ is a 17-item questionnaire used to assess the participant's AD-specific health-related quality of life. Each item is rated on a 5-point scale from 0 to 4, with higher numbers indicating greater burden. The questionnaire assesses AD's impact on emotions, energy, activities of daily living, and social activities. The ADIQ has a recall specification of 7 days. Assessments were recorded by the participant using an electronic diary and transferred to the clinical database.The ADIQ score is calculated by summing the score of each of the 14 questions resulting in a maximum of 56 and a minimum of 0, with higher scores indicating greater burden., Baseline, Week 16",,Eli Lilly and Company,"Dermira, Inc.",ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE2,280,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: TRIPLE (PARTICIPANT, INVESTIGATOR, OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",17826|J2T-DM-KGAF|DRM06-AD01,2018-01-30,2019-02-07,2019-05-23,2018-02-22,2021-04-09,2021-05-04,"Clear Dermatology & Aesthetics Center, Scottsdale, Arizona, 85255, United States|Dermatology Trial Associates, Bryant, Arkansas, 72022, United States|Northwest Arkansas Clinical Trials Center, Rogers, Arkansas, 72758, United States|Center for Dermatology Clinical Research, Inc., Fremont, California, 94538, United States|University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California, 90033, United States|Dermatology Research Associates, Los Angeles, California, 90045, United States|Stanford Medicine Outpatient Center-Medical Dermatology Clinic, Redwood City, California, 94063, United States|Center for Dermatology and Laser Surgery, Sacramento, California, 95819, United States|UCSD Dermatology, San Diego, California, 92122, United States|TCR Medical Corporation, San Diego, California, 92123, United States|Clinical Science Institute, Santa Monica, California, 90404, United States|George Washington Medical Faculty Associates, Washington, District of Columbia, 20037, United States|Total Vein and Skin, Boynton Beach, Florida, 33437, United States|Florida Academic Centers Research and Education, LLC, Coral Gables, Florida, 33134, United States|Olympian Clinical Research, Largo, Florida, 33770, United States|Tory Sullivan, MD PA, North Miami Beach, Florida, 33162, United States|International Clinical Research - US, LLC, Sanford, Florida, 32771, United States|Integrated Clinical Research, LLC, West Palm Beach, Florida, 33406, United States|Marietta Dermatology Clinical Research, Inc., Marietta, Georgia, 30060, United States|Advanced Medical Research, PC, Sandy Springs, Georgia, 30328, United States|Dundee Dermatology, West Dundee, Illinois, 60118, United States|Dawes Fretzin Clinical Research Group, LLC, Indianapolis, Indiana, 46256, United States|The Indiana Clinical Trials Center, Plainfield, Indiana, 46168, United States|Kansas City Dermatology, PA, Overland Park, Kansas, 66215, United States|Skin Sciences, PLLC, Louisville, Kentucky, 40217, United States|Meridian Clinical Research, LLC, Baton Rouge, Louisiana, 70808, United States|Dermatology and Skin Cancer Specialists, LLC, Rockville, Maryland, 20850, United States|ActivMed Practices & Research, Inc., Beverly, Massachusetts, 01915, United States|Tufts Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts, 02111, United States|Somerset Skin Centre, Troy, Michigan, 48084, United States|JDR Dermatology Research, Las Vegas, Nevada, 89148, United States|ActivMed Practices & Research, Inc., Portsmouth, New Hampshire, 03801, United States|Academic Dermatology Associates, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87106, United States|Schweiger Dermatology, PLLC, New York, New York, 10022, United States|Icahn School of Medicine, New York, New York, 10029, United States|Sadick Research Group, LLC., New York, New York, 10075, United States|DermResearchCenter of New York, Inc., Stony Brook, New York, 11790, United States|Piedmont Plastic Surgery and Dermatology, Charlotte, North Carolina, 28277, United States|Wake Research Associates, LLC, Raleigh, North Carolina, 27612, United States|Wilmington Dermatology Center, Wilmington, North Carolina, 28405, United States|University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center, Cleveland, Ohio, 44106, United States|Lynn Health Science Institute, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, 73112, United States|Oregon Medical Research Center, Portland, Oregon, 97223, United States|Clinical Partners, LLC, Johnston, Rhode Island, 02919, United States|Clinical Research Center of the Carolinas, Charleston, South Carolina, 29407, United States|Rivergate Dermatology Clinical Research Center, Goodlettsville, Tennessee, 37072, United States|International Clinical Research - Tennessee LLC, Murfreesboro, Tennessee, 37130, United States|Tennessee Clinical Research Center, Nashville, Tennessee, 37215, United States|Arlington Research Center, Inc., Arlington, Texas, 76011, United States|Westlake Dermatology Clinical Research Center, Austin, Texas, 78746, United States|Bellaire Dermatology Associates, Bellaire, Texas, 77401, United States|Menter Dermatology Research, Dallas, Texas, 75246, United States|The University of Texas Health, Houston, Texas, 77030, United States|Progressive Clinical Research, PA, San Antonio, Texas, 78213, United States|Center for Clinical Studies, LTD.
