At each visit, 3 measurements are taken per treatment area (at 3 different areas of the target lesion). The TEWL value at each visit is the average of these measurements., Baseline and Day 15|Change From Baseline to Day 15 in Participants' Assessment of Pruritus, Severity of pruritus is assessed by the participants and recorded on a numeric scale ranging from 0 to 10, where 0 indicates the absence of the symptoms and 10 indicates the most severe symptoms., Baseline and Day 15",,AstraZeneca,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE2,40,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: QUADRUPLE (PARTICIPANT, CARE_PROVIDER, INVESTIGATOR, OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",ROF-DERM_203|2012-003000-12|U1111-1133-6455,2013-06,2014-03,2014-03,2013-05-17,2015-03-11,2017-02-01,"Berlin, Germany|Gera, Germany|Hamburg, Germany",
