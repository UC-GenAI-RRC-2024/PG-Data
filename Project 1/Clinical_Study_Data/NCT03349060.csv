EQ-5D health state profile had 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: 1= no problems, 2= slight problems, 3= moderate problems, 4= severe problems, and 5= extreme problems. Responses to 5 dimensions comprised a health state/a single utility index value. E.g. if a participant responded ""no problems"" for each 5 dimensions, then health state was coded as ""11111"" with a predefined index value to it. Every health state (coded as combination of responses on each of 5 dimensions) had a unique predefined utility index value assigned to it, by EuroQol. US value sets (with all possible health states) was used for adults in the study, range from 1 to -0.109.

Participants (aged above 17 years) scored each item on a 5-point scale: 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much). Higher the participant's response to the questions (with the exception of 2 negatively stated) greater was the participant's fatigue. For all questions, except for the 2 negatively stated ones, the code was reversed and a new score was calculated as (4 minus the participant's response). The sum of all responses resulted in the FACIT-F score for a total possible score of 0 (worse score) to 52 (the best score) where higher scores indicated better overall health status (less fatigue)., Baseline, Week 12|Change From Baseline in Pediatric Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy Fatigue Scale (Peds-FACIT-F) at Week 12, Peds-FACIT-F is a 13-item questionnaire for adolescents of 12-17 years of age.

Higher the participant's response to the questions (with the exception of 2 negatively stated), greater was the participant's fatigue. For all questions, except for the 2 negatively stated ones, the code was reversed and a new score was calculated as (4 minus the participant's response).
