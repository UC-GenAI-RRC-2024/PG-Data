NCT03667014,The Impact of Dupilumab on Quality of Life in Moderate to Severe Atopic Dermatitis Patients,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03667014,,COMPLETED,"This is a single-arm, open-label study, which will examine the effect of dupilumab on quality of life in atopic dermatitis patients.",YES,Atopic Dermatitis|Atopic Dermatitis Eczema,DRUG: Dupilumab,"Psychological General Well-Being Scale (PGWB), The primary endpoint is the improvement in quality of life measured by change in Psychological General Well-Being scale (PGWB) at Week 16 from baseline. It is a self-reported, 22 item questionnaire, scored 0-5 and summed. PGWB will be administered at every study visit., 16 weeks","Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Scale (WPAI:SHP), Improvement in work productivity measured by change in Work Productivity and Activity Impairment scale (WPAI) at Week 16 from baseline. It measures the effect of health and symptom severity on work productivity and nonwork activities by assessing absenteeism, presenteeism, and impairment of daily activities. There are 6 questions, each with unique answers. WPAI outcomes are expressed as impairment percentages (0-100), with higher numbers indicating greater impairment and less productivity.

Scoring equations:

1. Percent work time missed due to problem: Q2/(Q2+Q4)
2. Percent impairment while working due to problem: Q5/10
3. Percent overall work impairment due to problem:

   Q2/(Q2+Q4)+\[(1-(Q2/(Q2+Q4)))x(Q5/10)\]
4. Percent activity impairment due to problem: Q6/10, 16 weeks|Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI), Improvement in quality of life measured by change in Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) at Week 16 from baseline. It is a 10 item questionnaire with a final score calculated by summing the score of each question resulting in a maximum of 30 and a minimum of 0. The higher the score, the more quality of life is impaired., 16 weeks|Itch Numerical Rating Scale, Improvement in itch scores using numerical rating scales at Week 16 from baseline. This is a 0-10 scale with 0 equaling No itch, and 10 being Worst imaginable itch. Patients will circle number that describes the itch experienced from atopic dermatitis., 16 weeks|Pain Numerical Rating Scale, Improvement in pain scores using numerical rating scales at Week 16 from baseline.

Patients circle the number that best describes the pain experienced from atopic dermatitis., 16 weeks|PSQI, Improvement in sleep quality measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Assessment (PSQI) at Week 16 from baseline. In scoring the PSQI, seven component scores are derived, each scored 0 (no difficulty) to 3 (severe difficulty). The component scores are summed to produce a global score (range 0 to 21). Higher scores indicate worse sleep quality., 16 weeks",,"University of California, San Francisco",Regeneron Pharmaceuticals,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE4,34,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: NA|Intervention Model: SINGLE_GROUP|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,Dupilimuab Quality of Life,2018-11-01,2022-12-15,2022-12-15,2018-09-12,2023-12-15,2024-01-09,"UCSF Psoriasis and Skin Treatment Center, San Francisco, California, 94118, United States","Study Protocol and Statistical Analysis Plan, https://storage.googleapis.com/ctgov2-large-docs/14/NCT03667014/Prot_SAP_000.pdf"
