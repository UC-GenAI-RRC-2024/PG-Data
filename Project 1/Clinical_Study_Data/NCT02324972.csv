NCT02324972,Pilot Efficacy and Safety Study of AQX-1125 in Atopic Dermatitis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02324972,KINSHIP,COMPLETED,The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of 12 weeks of treatment with once daily administration of AQX-1125 compared to placebo on change from baseline in Total Lesion Symptom Score in subjects with mild to moderate atopic dermatitis,YES,Atopic Dermatitis,DRUG: AQX-1125|DRUG: Placebo,"Change From Baseline in Total Lesion Symptom Score (TLSS), The TLSS is an assessment of the severity of each of the following three signs: erythema, papulation/infiltration, excoriation and lichenification. Each of these items are rated using a 4-point scale severity where 0 is clear, 1 = mild, 2= moderate and 3 = severe. These ratings are then added to create a total score ranging from 0 to 12, 12 weeks","Change From Baseline in Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA), The IGA is a global assessment of the current state of the disease. It is a 5-point morphological assessment of overall disease severity and will be determined according to the following categories: 0 (clear), 1 (almost clear), 2 (mild), 3 (moderate) and 4 (severe)., 12 weeks|Change From Baseline in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) Score, The Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) quantifies the severity of a subject's atopic dermatitis based on both lesion severity and the percentage of body surface area (BSA) affected. Lesions are assessed on four domains; 1) erythema, 2) induration/papulation, 3) excoriation and 4) lichenification. Each domain is scored separately over four body regions (head/neck, upper limbs, trunk and lower limbs) on a scale of 0-3 (0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate and 3 = severe) with adjustment for the percentage of BSA involved for each body region and for the proportion of the body region relative to the whole body. The sum of these scores provides the EASI total score, ranging from 0 to 72 with a higher score indicating greater severity of atopic dermatitis., 12 weeks|Change From Baseline in Scoring Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) Score, The severity scoring of atopic dermatitis (SCORAD) index is a standard tool to assess the atopic dermatitis (AD) severity in clinical studies. Six items; erythema, edema/papulation, oozing/crusts, excoriation, lichenification and dryness are measured on a scale from 0-3 for a total of 18 points, with a higher score indicating greater severity. The percentage of BSA affected by AD is evaluated (percentage divided by 5) and added to the total SCORAD score. Loss of sleep and pruritus are also evaluated by subjects on a visual analog scale (scores ranging from 0-10) with a higher score indicating greater severity. The sum of these measures represents the SCORAD which ranges from 0 (absent disease) to 103 (severe disease)., 12 weeks|Change From Baseline in Patient Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM) Score, The POEM is a 7-item self-assessment questionnaire that assesses disease symptoms (dryness, itching, flaking, cracking, sleep loss, bleeding and weeping) on a scale ranging from 0-4 (0 = no days, 1 = 1-2 days, 2 = 3-4 days, 3 = 5-6 days, 4 = everyday). The sum of the 7 items gives the total POEM score of 0 (absent disease) to 28 (severe disease). High scores are indicative of more severe disease and poor quality of life., 12 weeks",,Aquinox Pharmaceuticals (Canada) Inc.,Innovaderm Research Inc.,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE2,54,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: QUADRUPLE (PARTICIPANT, CARE_PROVIDER, INVESTIGATOR, OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",AQX-1125-204,2014-12,2015-11,2015-12,2014-12-24,2017-05-08,2018-10-05,"AQX-Innovaderm site, Montreal, Quebec, Canada",
