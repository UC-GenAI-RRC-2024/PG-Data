NCT03334435,A Study of Long-term Baricitinib (LY3009104) Therapy in Atopic Dermatitis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03334435,BREEZE-AD3,COMPLETED,"The purpose of this study is to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of baricitinib in participants with atopic dermatitis.

Participants were enrolled in this study from the originating studies (JAHL, JAHM, JAIY) or were directly enrolled in the open-label arm.",YES,Atopic Dermatitis,DRUG: Baricitinib|DRUG: Placebo,"Responder and Partial Responders (RPR): Number of Participants From Monotherapy Studies (JAHL, JAHM) Who Achieved a Response of Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) 0 or 1, The IGA measures the investigator's global assessment of the participant's overall severity of their atopic dermatitis (AD), based on a static, numeric 5-point scale from 0 (clear skin) to 4 (severe disease). The score is based on an overall assessment of the degree of erythema, papulation/induration, oozing/crusting, and lichenification.

The results were analyzed using non-responder imputation (NRI).
