NCT01366846,Persistence of Oral Tolerance to Peanut,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01366846,LEAP-On,COMPLETED,"ITN049AD (LEAP-On) Study is a continuation of the ITN032AD LEAP Study (NCT00329784).

Peanut Allergy, a recognized public health concern, is a common and potentially life-threatening food allergy for which there is no treatment. ITN032AD (LEAP) Study evaluated whether early exposure to peanut promotes tolerance and provides protection from developing peanut allergy in children who are allergic to eggs or who have severe eczema. ITN049AD (LEAP-On) Study will evaluate persistent tolerance to peanut by assessing the effect of twelve months of cessation of peanut consumption in LEAP Study participants who consumed peanut and those who avoided peanut over the previous five years.",YES,Eczema|Egg Allergy|Food Allergy|Hypersensitivity,OTHER: Avoidance of peanut,"Number of Participants With Peanut Allergy (PA) at 72 Months of Age - by Skin Prick Test Stratum, At 72 months of age, eligible participants were given an oral food challenge (oral intake of 5g of peanut protein in a single dose). Participants were considered to not have peanut allergy (PA) if they experienced no reaction following the food challenge. Those who did react were offered a double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenge with a total of 13.7g of peanut protein administered in increments. These participants were considered to have PA if they experienced a reaction at any point during the dose escalation. For participants for whom data from the oral food challenge were either inconclusive or not available, a diagnostic algorithm based on the results of a SPT and the values for peanut-specific IgE were used to determine whether or not a participant should be considered to have PA., 72 months|Number of Participants With Peanut Allergy (PA) at 72 Months of Age - by Treatment Group, At 72 months of age, eligible participants were given an oral food challenge (oral intake of 5g of peanut protein in a single dose).
