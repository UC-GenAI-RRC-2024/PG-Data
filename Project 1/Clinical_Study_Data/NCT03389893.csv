NCT03389893,Effect of Dupilumab (Anti-IL4Rα) on the Host-Microbe Interface in Atopic Dermatitis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03389893,,TERMINATED,"The purpose of this study is to understand the effect that T helper 2 (Th2) blockade has on well-described pathophysiological features of Atopic Dermatitis (AD), for example: barrier, epidermal activation, dysbiosis and epidermal lipids.",YES,Atopic Dermatitis (AD),DRUG: Dupilumab|DRUG: Placebo,"Staphylococcus Aureus Abundance on Lesional Skin, Dupilumab+Open Label Extension and Follow-Up Versus Placebo+Open Label Extension and Follow-Up, Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) abundance was measured by microbial DNA (femA qPCR) on lesional skin at Day 28, measurement is expressed in relative Colony Forming Units (rCFU)/cm\^2).

The abundance of S. aureus is summarized as the geometric mean ratio (and corresponding 95% confidence interval) between the dupilumab and placebo arms. The geometric mean ratio is reported from an ANCOVA model with fixed effects for clinical site, disease severity at Day 0 (as measured by EASI \>21.1 \[severe\] or ≤21.1 \[non-severe\]) and S. aureus abundance at Day 0., Day 28 (Post treatment initiation)","Staphylococcus Aureus Abundance on Lesional Skin, Dupilumab+Open Label Extension and Follow-Up Versus Placebo+Open Label Extension and Follow-Up, Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) abundance was measured by microbial DNA (femA qPCR) on lesional skin at Days 0, 3, 7, 14, 21, 42, 77 and 112.

The abundance of S. aureus is summarized as the geometric mean ratio (GMR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval between the dupilumab and placebo arms. The GMR is reported from a linear mixed model for repeated measures with fixed effects for S. aureus abundance on lesional skin at Day 0, treatment arm, clinical site, disease severity at Day 0 as measured by EASI ≥ 21.1 or \< 21.1, time point of measurement (as a categorical variable), and an interaction term between treatment arm and pre-specified time point(s).

Basal TEWL =baseline measure (prior to tape stripping). An increase in TEWL values shows damage to the skin barrier function.

Basal TEWL was measured on non-lesional and lesional skin. Basal TEWL is summarized as the mean difference between the dupilumab and placebo arms. The mean difference is reported from two linear mixed models for repeated measures (lesional and non-lesional) with fixed effects for treatment arm, basal TEWL at Day 0, clinical site, and disease severity at Day 0 as measured by EASI ≥ 21.1 or \< 21.1 at Days 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, and 42.

TEWL AUC was calculated using the trapezoidal rule and represents skin barrier integrity. An increase in TEWL values shows damage to the skin barrier function.

TEWL AUC was measured on non-lesional skin at Days 0, 7, 14, 21, 28, 42, 77 and 112. The mean difference (between Groups) is reported from a linear mixed model for repeated measures with a random effect for participant and fixed effects for treatment arm, TEWL AUC at Day 0, clinical site, and disease severity at Day 0 as measured by EASI ≥ 21.1 or \< 21.1 at Days 7, 14, 21, 28, and 42.

The TEWL values measured at every 5 tape strips were used to model the TEWL slope. TEWL slope assesses skin barrier integrity. An increase in TEWL values shows damage to the skin barrier function.
