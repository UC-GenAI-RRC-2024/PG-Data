NCT03517566,A Study to Assess the Safety and Efficacy of ZPL389 in Patients With Moderate to Severe Atopic Dermatitis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03517566,,TERMINATED,"This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study to assess safety and efficacy of ZPL389 in subjects with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis with a total study duration up to 24 weeks",YES,Atopic Dermatitis,DRUG: Placebo|DRUG: ZPL389 3mg|DRUG: ZPL389 10mg|DRUG: ZPL389 30mg|DRUG: ZPL389 50mg,"Percentage of IGA Responders at Week 16, Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) score is used to determine the severity of atopic dermatitis symptoms and clinical response to treatment. It reflects a subject's overall disease severity for the whole body. The scale includes 0 = clear, 1 = almost clear, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate and 4 = severe. It is a static scale and does not refer to previous status of the subject.

IGA response is defined as achievement of an IGA score of 0 or 1 with a 2-point reduction from baseline without use of confounding therapy (e.g. rescue medication) up to the assessment time point.

Treatment discontinuations for lack of efficacy or adverse event are considered non-responders.

Percentage of responders was calculated based on a logistic regression model with response as outcome variable and treatment (dose as categorical variable) and baseline IGA as covariates., Week 16","Percent Change From Baseline in EASI Score at Week 16, Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) is used to assess the extend and severity of atopic dermatitis on a scale from 0 to 72 where 72 is worst eczema., Baseline, Week 16|Percent Change From Baseline in EASI Score Over Time, Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) is used to assess the extend and severity of atopic dermatitis on a scale from 0 to 72 where 72 is worst eczema., Baseline, Week 2, Week 4, Week 6, Week 8, Week 12|Percentage of EASI50 Responders Over Time, Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) is used to assess the extend and severity of atopic dermatitis on a scale from 0 to 72 where 72 is worst eczema.

EASI50 response is defined as achieving ≥ 50% improvement (reduction) in EASI score compared to baseline without use of confounding therapy (e.g. rescue medication) up to the assessment time point.

Treatment discontinuations for lack of efficacy or adverse event are considered non-responders.

Percentage of responders was calculated based on a logistic regression model with response as outcome variable and treatment (dose as categorical variable) and baseline EASI as covariates, Week 2, Week 4, Week 6, Week 8, Week 12, Week 16|Percentage of EASI75 Responders Over Time, Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) is used to assess the extend and severity of atopic dermatitis on a scale from 0 to 72 where 72 is worst eczema.

EASI75 response is defined as achieving ≥ 75% improvement (reduction) in EASI score compared to baseline without use of confounding therapy (e.g. rescue medication) up to the assessment time point.

Treatment discontinuations for lack of efficacy or adverse event are considered non-responders.
