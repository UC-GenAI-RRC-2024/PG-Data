For each region the percentage of skin affected and the severity (scored as none \[0\], mild \[1\], moderate \[2\], or severe \[3\]) for symptoms such as redness (erythema), thickness (induration, papulation, and edema), scratching (excoriation), and lichenification (lined skin) are assessed. Total score is calculated by summing the EASI scores of 6 symptoms across 4 body regions. The EASI score ranges from 0 (no disease) to 72 (worse disease)., Baseline and Week 16","Number of Participants With a 50% Reduction From Baseline in Eczema Area and Severity Index Score (EASI 50 Response) at Week 16, EASI measures the extent and severity of atopic eczema based on assessments of 4 body regions: head/neck, trunk, upper limbs and lower limbs.

For each region the percentage of skin affected and the severity (scored as none \[0\], mild \[1\], moderate \[2\], or severe \[3\]) for symptoms such as redness (erythema), thickness (induration, papulation, and edema), scratching (excoriation), and lichenification (lined skin) are assessed. Total score is calculated by summing the EASI scores of 6 symptoms across 4 body regions. The EASI score ranges from 0 (no disease) to 72 (worse disease)., Baseline and Week 16|Number of Participants Who Achieved a Reduction of ≥ 2 Points From Baseline in the Validated Investigator's Global Assessment for Atopic Dermatitis (vIGA-AD) at Week 16, The vIGA-AD is a static 5-point scale to evaluate AD severity globally:

0: Clear - No inflammatory signs of AD (no erythema, no induration/papulation, no lichenification, no oozing/crusting). Postinflammatory hyperpigmentation and/or hypopigmentation may be present

1. Almost clear - Barely perceptible erythema, barely perceptible induration/papulation, and/or minimal lichenification. No oozing or crusting
2. Mild - Slight but definite erythema (pink), slight but definite induration/papulation, and/or slight but definite lichenification. No oozing or crusting
3. Moderate - Clearly perceptible erythema (dull red), clearly perceptible induration/papulation, and/or clearly perceptible lichenification. Oozing and crusting may be present
4. Severe - Marked erythema (deep or bright red), marked induration/papulation, and/or marked lichenification. Disease is widespread in extent. Oozing or crusting may be present.

Number of participants with ≥2 points reduction in vIGA-AD is presented., Baseline and Week 16|Number of Participants Who Achieved a vIGA-AD Response of 0 (Clear) or 1 (Almost Clear) at Week 16, vIGA-AD is static 5-point scale to evaluate AD severity globally: 0: Clear - No inflammatory signs of AD (no erythema, no induration/papulation, no lichenification, no oozing/crusting). Postinflammatory hyperpigmentation and/or hypopigmentation may be present

1. Almost clear - Barely perceptible erythema, barely perceptible induration/papulation, and/or minimal lichenification. No oozing or crusting
2. Mild - Slight but definite erythema (pink), slight but definite induration/papulation, and/or slight but definite lichenification. No oozing or crusting

4. Severe - Marked erythema (deep or bright red), marked induration/papulation, and/or marked lichenification. Disease is widespread. Oozing or crusting may be present Participants who achieved vIGA-AD response of 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear) are reported., Week 16|Number of Participants Who Achieved a Reduction of ≥ 4 Points From Baseline in Weekly Averaged Peak Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) for Pruritus Score at Week 16, Participants were asked to rate itch (pruritis) intensity at its worst (peak) during the past 24 hours on an 11-point scale from 0 (no itch) to 10 (worst imaginable itch) in a daily electronic diary. Weekly average was calculated as the average of the 7 days before each visit., Baseline and Week 16|Percent Change From Baseline in Peak Weekly Averaged Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) for Pruritus Score at Week 16, Participants were asked to rate itch (pruritis) intensity at its worst (peak) during the past 24 hours on an 11-point scale from 0 (no itch) to 10 (worst imaginable itch) in a daily electronic diary. Weekly average was calculated as the average of the 7 days before each visit., Baseline and Week 16|Percent Change From Baseline in Scoring Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) Score at Week 16, SCORAD is a clinical tool used to assess the extent and severity of eczema (SCORing Atopic Dermatitis). The extent is assessed using the rule of 9 to calculate the affected area (A) as extent of disease (0 \[no disease\]-102 \[worst disease\]). The intensity part of the SCORAD (B) consists of 6 items: erythema, oedema/papulation, excoriations, lichenification, oozing/crusts and dryness, each graded on a scale from 0 (none) to 3 (severe), for a total score of 0 (none) to 18 (severe intensity). Subjective items (C) include daily pruritus and sleeplessness, each scored on a visual analogue scale (VAS) from 0 to 10 (itch: 0 \[no itch\] to 10 \[worst imaginable itch\] and sleeplessness: 0 \[no sleeplessness\] to 10 \[worst imaginable sleeplessness\]) (total score 0-20). SCORAD is calculated as A/5 + 7B/2 + C, and ranges from 0 (no AD present) to 103.4 (worst)., Baseline and Week 16|Change From Baseline in Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) Score at Week 16, The DLQI is a 10-item validated questionnaire used to assess the impact of AD disease symptoms and treatment on quality of life (QoL). It consists of 10 questions evaluating impact of skin diseases on different aspects of a participant's QoL over the prior week, including symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure, work or school, personal relationships, and the side effects of treatment. Each item is scored on a 4-point scale (0 = not at all/not relevant; 1 = a little; 2 = a lot; and 3 = very much). Item scores are added to provide a total score, ranging from 0 to 30, with higher scores indicating greater impairment of QoL. A negative change from Baseline indicates improvement., Baseline and Week 16|Number of Participants Who Experienced an Adverse Event (AE), An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical trial participant, temporally associated with the use of study treatment, whether or not considered related to the study treatment. A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) is any AE that started or worsened in severity on or after the date and time of the study drug administration. A serious adverse event (SAE) is as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose:

* Resulted in death;
* Was life-threatening;
* Required inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization;
* Resulted in persistent disability/incapacity;
* Was a congenital anomaly/birth defect., From first dose to Week 24",,"AnaptysBio, Inc.",,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE2,302,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: QUADRUPLE (PARTICIPANT, CARE_PROVIDER, INVESTIGATOR, OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",ANB020-005|2018-000331-27,2018-06-19,2019-12-03,2019-12-03,2018-05-23,2023-04-26,2023-05-24,"University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama, 35233, United States|Applied Research Center of Arkansas, Little Rock, Arkansas, 72212, United States|Encino Research Group, Encino, California, 91436, United States|Irvine Center for Clinical Research, Inc., Irvine, California, 92614, United States|Clinical Science Institute, Santa Monica, California, 90404, United States|Medical Research Center of Miami, Miami, Florida, 33134, United States|Compass Research Main, Orlando, Florida, 32806, United States|Moore Clinical Research Inc. -
