NCT01469767,Efficacy of Fluocinonide Cream 0.1% (Vanos(R)) in Reducing Itch in Subjects With Atopic Dermatitis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01469767,,COMPLETED,The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of short-term treatment with fluocinonide cream 0.1% (VanosÂ®) in the treatment of atopic dermatitis (AD).,YES,Atopic Dermatitis,DRUG: Fluocinonide cream,"IGA, Investigator's Global Assessment of atopic dermatitis integrates all lesions for overall score. This measure is commonly used to quantify disease severity and most resembles assessments performed in the clinic setting. Score ranges from '0' = Clear to '5' = Very Severe Disease, 14 days","Actigraphy, Actigraphy Movement Count per Hour:Subjects will be asked to wear an actigraphy monitor on each wrist for the duration of the 14-day study. These monitors appear and function similarly to a wristwatch. The actigraph provides a continuous measure of wrist activity and may be used to quantify nocturnal scratching behavior. A piezoelectric accelerometer records the integration of intensity, amount, and duration of stimuli in all 3 dimensions of wrist movement. Measurements are taken at 32 Hz and a summation value is recorded at the end of each 30-second epoch. The number of 30-second epochs with movement (in which acceleration was detected irrespective of the magnitude of the acceleration) is recorded and summed to give a movement score. This is divided by the duration of time in bed to produce a movement count per hour, which is a sensitive quantitative measure of scratch-associated activity., 14 days|EASI, Eczema Area and Severity Index Score:Disease severity will be assessed with the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI).This measure is commonly used and well validated instrument of eczema severity. It is weighted for area in each of the four body regions and scores erythema, excoriation, induration/papulation, and lichenification. The total are summed for one total EASI score. .The total scores range from 0 (no Eczema) -72 (most severe Eczema)."", 14 days|BSA, Body Surface Area of atopic dermatitis. The BSA is measured as the total percent of the entire body with atopic dermatitis involved, so the scores range from 0% to 100% of total body involvement., 14 days|VAS, Visual Analog Scale for itch: A 100 millimeter (mm) Visual Analog Scale (VAS) will be used to measure itch intensity. VAS is a self-report tool that is designed to present to the respondent a rating scale with minimum constraints. VAS data is recorded as the number of mm from the left of the line with the range 0-100 mm. The Visual Analog Scale is anchored with the verbal descriptions of ""no itch"" on the left and ""the most intense itch imaginable"" on the right., 14 days",,Wake Forest University,Medicis Pharmaceutical Corporation,ALL,"CHILD, ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE2,10,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: NA|Intervention Model: SINGLE_GROUP|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,IRB00018876,2012-02-01,2013-08-17,2013-08-17,2011-11-10,2017-01-27,2018-09-07,"Wake Forest University Health Sciences, Winston-Salem, North Carolina, 27157, United States",
