NCT00455429,An Efficacy and Safety Study of JNJ-26113100 in the Treatment of Adult Atopic Dermatitis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00455429,,TERMINATED,"The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of four dose regimens (pattern of giving treatment) of JNJ-26113100 in the treatment of adult Atopic Dermatitis (\[AD\]; skin rash, inflammation) that is moderate in severity.",YES,Atopic Dermatitis,DRUG: Placebo|DRUG: JNJ-26113100 (50 mg) once daily|DRUG: JNJ-26113100 (100 mg) once daily|DRUG: JNJ-26113100 (100 mg) twice daily|DRUG: JNJ-26113100 (250 mg) twice daily,"Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) Score at Week 6, Participants were reported for IGA. IGA is an overall assessment of Atopic Dermatitis (AD). IGA utilizes a 6-point scale (ranging from 0 to 5): 0=clear (noinflammatory signs of AD), 1=almost clear (just perceptible erythema, and just perceptible papulation/infiltration), 2=mild disease (mild erythema, and mild papulation/infiltration), 3=moderate disease (moderate erythema, and moderate papulation/infiltration), 4=severe disease (severe erythema, and severe papulation/infiltration) and 5=very severe disease (severe erythema, and severe papulation/infiltration with oozing/crusting)., Week 6|Change From Baseline in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) Score at Week 6, EASI measures erythema (E), infiltration (I), excoriation (Ex) and lichenification (L) on a scale of 0 (none) to 3 (severe) on 4 anatomic regions of the body: head, trunk, upper limbs, and lower limbs. Degree of involvement on each of the 4 anatomic regions is scored on a scale of 0 (no eruption) to 6 (greater than \[\>\] 90%-100% eruption). The total score is the sum of the four body-region scores, maximum=72, minimum=0, with higher scores reflecting greater disease severity. The total qualitative score is multiplied by the degree of involvement for each anatomic region and then multiplied by a constant and summed to yield the EASI score., Baseline and Week 6|Change From Baseline in Visual Analog Scale (VAS) Score for Pruritus at Week 6, VAS consists of 10 centimeter (cm) horizontal line and the words; 0 cm=""No itch"" on the left side of the line and the words 10 cm=""Worst possible itch"" on the right side of the line. Participants will be instructed to rate the severity of their pruritus within the previous 24 hours by drawing a vertical line across the 10 cm line at the point between ""No itch"" and ""Worst possible itch"" which best describes their itching during the preceding 24 hours., Baseline and Week 6|Percentage of Participants Achieving Treatment Response as ""Clear"" or ""Almost Clear ""in IGA, Percentage of participants achieving treatment response (decrease) in IGA were assessed. IGA is used to assess AD through a 6-point scale (Range=0-5) where, 0=clear (no inflammatory signs of AD), 1=almost clear (just perceptible erythema \& perceptible papulation/infiltration), 2=mild (mild erythema \& papulation/infiltration), 3=moderate (moderate erythema \& papulation/infiltration), 4=severe (severe erythema \& papulation/infiltration) \& 5=very severe (severe erythema \& papulation/infiltration with oozing/crusting). Success is reduction of IGA to 0 or 1. Failure is reduction of IGA to \>=2., Baseline up to Week 6|Percentage of Participants Achieving 50% Reduction in EASI Score at Week 6, EASI measures erythema (E), infiltration (I), excoriation (Ex) and lichenification (L) on a scale of 0 (none) to 3 (severe) on 4 anatomic regions of the body: head, trunk, upper limbs, and lower limbs. Degree of involvement on each of the 4 anatomic regions is scored on a scale of 0 (no eruption) to 6 (greater than \[\>\] 90%-100% eruption). The total score is the sum of the four body-region scores, maximum=72, minimum=0, with higher scores reflecting greater disease severity. The total qualitative score is multiplied by the degree of involvement for each anatomic region and then multiplied by a constant and summed to yield the EASI score. Success is defined as an improvement of \>=50% from the baseline EASI score. An improvement of \<50% is considered a failure., Baseline up to Week 6|Percentage of Participants Achieving Greater Than (>) or Equal to (=) 25% Reduction in EASI Score at Week 6, EASI measures erythema (E), infiltration (I), excoriation (Ex) and lichenification (L) on a scale of 0 (none) to 3 (severe) on 4 anatomic regions of the body: head, trunk, upper limbs, and lower limbs. Degree of involvement on each of the 4 anatomic regions is scored on a scale of 0 (no eruption) to 6 (greater than \[\>\] 90%-100% eruption). The total score is the sum of the four body-region scores, maximum=72, minimum=0, with higher scores reflecting greater disease severity. The total qualitative score is multiplied by the degree of involvement for each anatomic region and then multiplied by a constant and summed to yield the EASI score. Success is defined as an improvement of \>=25% from the baseline EASI score. An improvement of \<25% is considered a failure., Baseline up to Week 6|Percentage of Participants Achieving Greater Than (>) or Equal to (=) 75% Reduction in VAS Score for Pruritus at Week 6, VAS consists of 10 centimeter (cm) horizontal line and the words; 0 cm=""No itch"" on the left side of the line and the words 10 cm=""Worst Possible Itch"" on the right side of the line. Participants will be instructed to rate the severity of their pruritus within the previous 24 hours by drawing a vertical line across the 10 cm line at the point between ""No itch"" and ""Worst possible itch"" which best describes their itching during the preceding 24 hours. Success is defined as an improvement of \>=75% from the baseline VAS assessment of pruritus. An improvement of \<75% is a failure., Baseline up to Week 6|Percentage of Participants Achieving Greater Than (>) or Equal to (=) 50% Reduction in VAS Score for Pruritus at Week 6, VAS consists of 10 centimeter (cm) horizontal line and the words; 0 cm=""No itch"" on the left side of the line and the words 10 cm=""Worst possible itch"" on the right side of the line.
