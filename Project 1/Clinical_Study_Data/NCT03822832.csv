The EASI score assesses the extent of disease at four body sites and measures four clinical signs: (1) erythema, (2) induration/papulation, (3) excoriation, and (4) lichenification, each on a scale of zero to three. The EASI score confers a maximum of 72 and evaluates two dimensions of Atopic Dermatitis (AD): disease extent and clinical signs. The suggested severity strata for the EASI are as follows: 0 = clear; 0.1-1.0 = almost clear; 1.1-7.0 = mild; 7.1-21.0 = moderate; 21.1-50.0 = severe; 50.1-72.0 = very severe.

Double blind period: Baseline (week 1) to the last study drug administration date (week 12) + Residual effects period (REP, 16 weeks). For patients who initiated the re-allocation treatment period the REP was shortened to the date of first re-allocation treatment period treatment administration. Up to a total time frame of 28 weeks.

Extent (A): rule of 9 was used to calculate body surface area affected by AD. The score for each body region was added to determine A (0-100). Severity (B): severity of each sign (erythema; edema; oozing; excoriation; skin thickening; dryness) was assessed from none=0to severe=3. Severity scores summed to B (0-18). Subjective symptoms (C): pruritus and sleep, each of these 2 were scored by participant/caregiver using visual analogue scale from 0 to 10, higher scores=worse symptoms. Scores for itch and sleeplessness were added to give 'C' (0-20). The SCORAD for an individual was calculated: A/5 + 7\*B/2 + C; range from 0 to 103; higher values of SCORAD=worse outcome.

IGA score allows investigators to assess the overall disease severity at one given time point. It is a 5-point scale with: 0 = clear, 1 = almost clear, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate, and 4 = severe. The overall IGA score includes the assessment of erythema, induration/papulation, lichenification, and oozing/crusting. For the first three sections the following scale will be used: ""None"", ""Barely Perceptible"" (""Minimal"" for lichenification), ""Slight but Definite"", ""Clearly Perceptible"" or ""Marked"".
