NCT03531957,Phase 2B Study to Evaluate ASN002 in Subjects With Moderate to Severe Atopic Dermatitis (RADIANT),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03531957,,COMPLETED,This is a randomized double-blind/placebo study evaluate the efficacy of ASN002 in subjects with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis (AD).,YES,Atopic Dermatitis,DRUG: ASN002|DRUG: Placebo Oral Tablet,"Change From Baseline in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) at Week 12, The Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) is a composite score ranging from 0 to 72, the higher the value the worse the disease, that takes into account the degree of erythema, induration/infiltration (papules), excoriation, and lichenification (each scored from 0 to 3 separately) for each of four body regions, with adjustment for the percentage of BSA involved for each body region and for the proportion of the body region to the whole body., Week 12","Percent of Participant With at Least a 75% Reduction From Baseline in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI75), Percent of participants with at least a 75% reduction from baseline in EASI (EASI75) at Week 12, Week 12|Change From Baseline in 5-D Pruritus (Itching) Scale, The 5-D Pruritus Scale is a 1-page, 5-question, validated questionnaire used in clinical trials to assess 5 dimensions of background itch: degree, duration, direction, disability, and distribution. Each question corresponds to 1 of the 5 dimensions of itch; subjects rated their symptoms over the preceding 2-week period as ""present"" or on a 1 to 5 scale, with 5 being the most affected. The total score of 5-D pruritus is a sum of the 5 scores to provide a total score range from 5 (best) to 25 (worst)., Week 12|Percent Change From Baseline in SCORing Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD), In the SCORAD grading system, six items (erythema, edema/papulation, oozing/crusts, excoriation, lichenification, and dryness) evaluate the Atopic Dermatitis severity. The overall body surface area affected by atopic dermatitis was evaluated (from 0% to 100%) and included in the SCORAD scores. Loss of sleep and pruritus were evaluated by subjects on a visual analog scale (0-10) and were based on the average of the last three days/nights. The sum of these measures represented the SCORAD, which could range from 0 to 103. The higher the score the more severe the disease., Week 12|Percentage of Participants With a Response of Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) 0 or 1, The IGA is a global assessment of the current state of the disease. It is a 5-point (0-4) morphological assessment of overall disease severity. The 0 is the least severe and 4 is the most severe., Week 12|Change From Baseline in Patient-Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM), The Patient-Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM) is a self-assessment of disease severity by the subject. The POEM has a maximum value of 28 based on the subject's response to seven questions scored from 0 to 4. The higher the value the more severe the disease is., Week 12|Change From Baseline in Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI), Dermatology Life Quality Index Questionnaire (DLQI) is a simple 10-question validated questionnaire that has been used in more than 40 different skin conditions. The DLQI total score is defined as the sum of the 10 item scales, ranging from 0 to 30. The higher the value, the more severe the disease is., Week 12|Change From Baseline in Body Surface Area (BSA), The overall body surface area (BSA) affected by atopic dermatitis is evaluated (from 0% to 100%)., Week 12",,Asana BioSciences,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE2,244,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: QUADRUPLE (PARTICIPANT, CARE_PROVIDER, INVESTIGATOR, OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",ASN002AD-201,2018-07-05,2019-07-22,2019-08-14,2018-05-22,2021-05-20,2023-07-03,"Pinnacle Research Group, LLC, Anniston, Alabama, 36207, United States|Total Skin and Dermatology Center, PC., Birmingham, Alabama, 35205, United States|Center for Dermatology Clinical Research, Inc., Fremont, California, 94538, United States|L.A.
