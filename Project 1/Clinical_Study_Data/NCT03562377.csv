NCT03562377,Vaccine Responses in Tralokinumab-Treated Atopic Dermatitis - ECZTRA 5 (ECZema TRAlokinumab Trial No. 5),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03562377,ECZTRA 5,COMPLETED,"The purpose of this trial is to test if treatment with the trial drug, tralokinumab, can affect the body's immune response to vaccines. The trial will also evaluate the efficacy of tralokinumab when it is given concomitantly with vaccines.\> The trial includes a screening period of 2 to 6 weeks, a treatment period of 16 weeks (Weeks 0 to 16), and a 14-week off-treatment follow-up period for the assessment of safety (Weeks 16 to 30). Eligible subjects may transfer to an open-label, long-term trial at Week 16 or later.",YES,Atopic Dermatitis,DRUG: Tralokinumab|DRUG: Placebo|BIOLOGICAL: Tdap vaccine|BIOLOGICAL: Meningococcal vaccine,"Positive Anti-tetanus Response at Week 16, The antibody response to Tdap vaccine will be assessed by measuring serum anti-tetanus IgG by an immunoassay. A positive response is defined as a 3-fold IgG increase compared to Week 12 if IgG ≤1.0 IU/mL at Week 12; or IgG ≥2.5 IU/mL if IgG \>1.0 IU/mL at Week 12., Week 12 to Week 16|Positive Anti-meningococcal Response at Week 16, The antibody response to meningococcal vaccine will be assessed by measuring serum anti-meningococcal IgG by an immunoassay. A positive response is defined as at least a 3-fold increase compared to Week 12., Week 12 to Week 16","Participants With Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) Score of 0 (Clear) or 1 (Almost Clear) at Week 16, The IGA is an instrument used in clinical trials to rate the severity of the subject's global atopic dermatitis and is based on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (clear) to 4 (severe)., Week 0 to Week 16|Participants Achieving at Least 75% Reduction in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) at Week 16., The EASI is a validated measure used in clinical practice and clinical trials to assess the severity and extent of atopic dermatitis.

\> The EASI is a composite index with scores ranging from 0 to 72, with higher values indicating more severe and/or more extensive condition., Week 0 to Week 16|Number of AEs., Overall summary of AEs during the treatment period is presented. For list of SAEs and frequent AEs by MedDRA system organ class (SOC) and preferred term (PT) during the entire trial period (including safety follow-up), see Adverse Events Overview section., Week 0 to Week 16|Presence of Anti-drug Antibodies (ADA)., ADA levels were measured using a validated bioanalytical method. Data were reported in the following categories: positive (presence of ADA at baseline and/or presence of ADA at at least 1 post-baseline assessment), perishing (presence of ADA at baseline and absence of ADA at all post-baseline assessments), negative (absence of ADA at all assessments), no post-baseline ADA assessment., Week 0 to Week 16",,LEO Pharma,,ALL,ADULT,PHASE2,215,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: DOUBLE (PARTICIPANT, INVESTIGATOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",LP0162-1341,2018-07-13,2019-09-17,2019-11-22,2018-06-19,2021-01-14,2022-10-19,"Leo Pharma Investigational Site, Fort Smith, Arkansas, 72916, United States|LEO Pharma Investigational Site, Bakersfield, California, 93301, United States|Leo Pharma Investigational Site, Beverly Hills, California, 90212, United States|Leo Pharma Investigational Site, Fountain Valley, California, 92708, United States|Leo Pharma Investigational Site, Los Angeles, California, 90025, United States|Leo Pharma Investigational Site, Los Angeles, California, 90045, United States|Leo Pharma Investigational Site, Los Angeles, California, 90057, United States|Leo Pharma Investigational Site, Newport Beach, California, 92660, United States|LEO Pharma Investigational Site, San Diego, California, 92123, United States|LEO Pharma Investigational Site, Centennial, Colorado, 80112, United States|LEO Pharma Investigational Site, Denver, Colorado, 80045, United States|LEO Pharma Investigational Site, Thornton, Colorado, 80233, United States|Leo Pharma Investigational Site, Coral Gables, Florida, 33134, United States|Leo Pharma Investigational Site, Doral, Florida, 33122, United States|Leo Pharma Investigational Site, Hialeah, Florida, 33012, United States|LEO Pharma Investigational Site, Atlanta, Georgia, 30328, United States|Leo Pharma Investigational Site, New Albany, Indiana, 47150, United States|Leo Pharma Investigational Site, South Bend, Indiana, 46617, United States|LEO Pharma Investigational Site, Bangor, Maine, 04401, United States|Leo Pharma Investigational Site, Boston, Massachusetts, 02115, United States|LEO Pharma Investigational Site, Brighton, Massachusetts, 02135, United States|Leo Pharma Investigational Site, Ann Arbor, Michigan, 48103, United States|LEO Pharma Investigational Site, Southfield, Michigan, 48034, United States|Leo Pharma Investigational Site, Missoula, Montana, 59808, United States|Leo Pharma Investigational Site, East Windsor, New Jersey, 08520, United States|LEO Pharma Investigational Site, Brooklyn, New York, 11201, United States|Leo Pharma Investigational Site, Cortland, New York, 13045, United States|Leo Pharma Investigational Site, Forest Hills, New York, 11375, United States|Leo Pharma Investigational Site, New York, New York, 10021, United States|Leo Pharma Investigational Site, Cincinnati, Ohio, 45219, United States|LEO Pharma Investigational Site, Cincinnati, Ohio, 45231, United States|LEO Pharma Investigational Site, Gahanna, Ohio, 43230, United States|LEO Pharma Investigational Site, Medford, Oregon, 97504, United States|Leo Pharma Investigational Site, Chattanooga, Tennessee, 37421, United States|Leo Pharma Investigational Site, Austin, Texas, 78759, United States|LEO Pharma Investigational Site, Dallas, Texas, 75225, United States|Leo Pharma Investigational Site, Frisco, Texas, 75034, United States|Leo Pharma Investigational Site, South Burlington, Vermont, 05403, United States|Leo Pharma Investigational Site, Spokane, Washington, 99202, United States|LEO Pharma Investigational Site, Edmonton, Alberta, T5K 1X3, Canada|LEO Pharma Investigational Site, Edmonton, Alberta, T6G 1C3, Canada|LEO Pharma Investigational Site, Vancouver, British Colombia, V6H 4E1, Canada|LEO Pharma Investigational Site, Saint John's, New Foundland & Labrador, A1A 4Y3, Canada|LEO Pharma Investigational Site, Hamilton, Ontario, L8S 1G5, Canada|LEO Pharma Investigational Site, London, Ontario, N6H 5L5, Canada|LEO Pharma Investigational Site, Oakville, Ontario, L6J 7W5, Canada|LEO Pharma Investigational Site, Peterborough, Ontario, K9J 5K2, Canada|LEO Pharma Investigational Site, Richmond Hill, Ontario, L4B 1A5, Canada|LEO Pharma Investigational Site, Toronto, Ontario, M4V 1R2, Canada|LEO Pharma Investigational Site, Windsor, Ontario, N8X 2G1, Canada|LEO Pharma Investigational Site, Verdun, Quebec, H4G 3E7, Canada","Study Protocol, https://storage.googleapis.com/ctgov2-large-docs/77/NCT03562377/Prot_000.pdf|Statistical Analysis Plan, https://storage.googleapis.com/ctgov2-large-docs/77/NCT03562377/SAP_001.pdf"
