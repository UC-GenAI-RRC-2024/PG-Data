NCT00832585,Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Alefacept (Amevive) in Subjects With Moderate to Severe Atopic Dermatitis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00832585,,COMPLETED,"This study will assess the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of Alefacept in patient with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis who could not be adequately controlled with topical therapies.",YES,Atopic Dermatitis,DRUG: Alefacept,"Change in Eczema Area Severity Index (EASI) Score From Baseline (Week 1) to Week 16., The Eczema Area Severity Index (EASI) measures erythema (E), infiltration (I), excoriation (Ex) and lichenification (L) using 0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe. Head/neck, upper limbs, trunk, lower limbs are rated from 1 to 6 (0=no eruption, 1=1-9%, 2=10-29%, 3=30-49%, 4=50-69%, 5=70-89%, 6=90-100%). The proportional factor for the head/neck =.01, upper limbs=.02, trunk=.03 and lower limbs=.04. The algorithm for calculating the EASI is the sum of E+I+Ex+L multiplied by the area, multiplied by the proportional factor. The total score is the sum of the four body-region scores, max=72, min=0., Week 1 to week 16","Change in Physician Global Assessment (PGA) Score From Baseline (Week 1) to Week 16., The Physician Global Assessment (PGA) evaluates the overall severity of Atopic Dermatitis (AD) at a given time using a four point scale (0=clear, 0.5=clear to mild, 1=mild, 1.5=mild to moderate, 2=moderate, 2.5=moderate to severe, and 3=severe)., Week 1 to week 16",,Rush University Medical Center,"Astellas Pharma US, Inc.",ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE4,5,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: NA|Intervention Model: SINGLE_GROUP|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,AC 07-001,2008-01,2009-09,2009-10,2009-01-30,2010-07-09,2011-03-10,"Rush University Medical Center - Department of Dermatology, Chicago, Illinois, 60612, United States",
