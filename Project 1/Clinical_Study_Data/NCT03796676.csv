The EQ-5D-Y is a version of the instrument specifically developed and validated for use by youths aged 12 through 17 years. Components assess level of current health for 5 domains: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain and discomfort, anxiety and depression. Score scale for each domain ranges from 1 (minimum) to 3 (maximum), with higher scores indicating worse health condition. In addition, respondents use a vertical, graduated Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) to rate their own health between 0 (the worst) and 100 (the best health state he/she can imagine)., Baseline, Weeks 2, 4, 8 and 12|Change From Baseline in Pediatric Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy Fatigue Scale (Peds-FACIT-F) at Week 12, The Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy Fatigue Scale (FACIT-F) is a 13-item questionnaire. Participants scored each item on a 5-point scale: 0 (none of the time) to 4 (all of the time). Larger the participant's response to the questions (with the exception of 2 negatively stated), greater was the participant's fatigue. For all questions, except for the 2 negatively stated ones, the code was reversed and a new score was calculated as (4 minus the participant's response). The sum of all responses resulted in the FACIT-F score for a total possible score of 0 (worse score) to 52 (better score), with higher scores representing better overall health status (less fatigue). Changes from baseline at Week 12 are presented below. Changes from baseline at other scheduled time points were not evaluated., Baseline to Week 12|Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), An adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a product; the event did not need to have a causal relationship with the treatment.

All scheduled ECGs were performed after the participant had rested quietly for at least 10 minutes in a supine position. Reading of ECGs were performed by a central reader who has expertise reading and interpreting ECGs in adolescents.

Participants who completed 8 weeks of treatment with study intervention received Tdap at Week 8, and had blood samples collected for the evaluation of immunogenicity to the vaccine at Weeks 8 and 12. The fold increase was defined as the ratio (post-vaccination: pre-vaccination) of concentration values. The geometric mean fold rise (GMFR) is presented below, and was calculated by first arithmetically averaging the logarithmically transformed ratio (post-vaccination: pre-vaccination) values, and then back transformation.
