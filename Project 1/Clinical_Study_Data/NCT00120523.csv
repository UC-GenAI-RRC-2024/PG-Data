CI = Confidence interval for treatment success using binomial distribution: lower CI\<0 is set to 0, upper CI\>100 is set to 100.

Treatment success (n): IGA score of 0 or 1 (clear or almost clear). Outcome gives percentage of patients with treatment success., throughout the 5-year study|Body Surface Area Involved With Atopic Dermatitis, TBSA = Total body surface area; percent BSA affected = (BSA affected/TBSA) x 100., throughout the 5-year study|Parent's Index of Quality of Life - Atopic Dermatitis (PIQoL-AD), PIQoL-AD questionnaire (28 questions) was only done in countries where validated questionnaire was available: Germany, Hungary, Netherlands, Spain, UK and US.

For the purposes of data presentation, a ""Not True"" response was coded a value of zero and a ""True"" a value of one. The total score (i.e., sum of individual questions) was calculated; lower the score, better the QoL. Minimum score = 0; maximum score = 28. If the patient has answered â‰¤14 questions at a time point, then the patient's total score at the time point was set to missing., throughout the 5-year study|Vital Signs and Physical Examinations: Blood Pressure (BP), Significant findings are included in the relevant medical history/current medical conditions (prior to study start) or in the AE documentation (after study start., throughout the 5-year study|Vital Signs and Physical Examinations: Pulse, Significant findings are included in the relevant medical history/current medical conditions (prior to study start) or in the AE documentation (after study start., throughout the 5-year study",,MEDA Pharma GmbH & Co.
