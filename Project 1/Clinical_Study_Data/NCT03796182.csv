NCT03796182,Study of PF 04965842 Effect on MATE1/2K Activity in Healthy Participants,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03796182,,COMPLETED,"This is a Phase 1, randomized, 2 way crossover, open label study of the effect of PF-04965842 on metformin (a probe for MATE1/2K activity) PK in healthy adult participants. The effect of PF-04965842 on N1-methylnicotinamide (NMN; an endogenous biomarker for MATE1/2K) PK and its correlation to the effect on metformin PK will also be assessed. Participants will be randomized to 1 of 2 treatment sequences as described below. A total of 12 healthy male and/or female participants will be enrolled in the study so that 6 participants will be enrolled in each treatment sequence. Each treatment sequence will consist of 2 periods.",YES,Healthy,DRUG: Metformin|DRUG: PF-04965842,"Renal Clearance (CLr) of Metformin, CLr was calculated as cumulative amount of drug recovered unchanged in urine during the dosing interval (Ae) divided by area under the plasma concentration time-curve from time zero to end of dosing interval (AUCtau)., For both Period 1 and Period 2 at intervals of 0-12, 12-24, 24-36, and 36-48 hours post metformin dose","Area Under the Plasma Concentration-time Profile From Time 0 Extrapolated to Infinite Time (AUCinf) of Metformin, AUCinf is a measure of the serum concentration of the drug over time.
