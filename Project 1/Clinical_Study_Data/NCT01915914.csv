NCT01915914,"A Randomized, Open-label, Comparative Study to Evaluate an Intermittent Dosing Regimen of Fluticasone Propionate 0.05% Cream (Twice Per Week) in Reducing the Risk of Relapse When Added to Regular Daily Moisturization Using PHYSIOGEL Lotion in Paediatric Subjects With Stabilized Atopic Dermatitis",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01915914,,COMPLETED,"This is an open-label, randomized, comparative study, including 4 phases: SCREENING, ACUTE, MAINTENANCE and FOLLOW-UP.

Subjects will complete the SCREENING phase to check the eligibility within 7 days after they sign the written informed consent form. All eligible subjects will be enrolled in ACUTE phase to receive twice daily Fluticasone propionate (FP) 0.05% cream up to 4 weeks. The efficacy and safety in ACUTE phase will be assessed every 2 weeks up to 4 weeks or until Treatment Success which depends on which time point comes first. Then subject can get into the MAINTENANCE phase receiving either emollient twice daily plus FP 0.05% cream once daily twice a week (Group A), or emollient twice daily (Group B), by 1:1 randomization. The treatment duration in MAINTENANCE phase will be up to 20 weeks. The efficacy and safety in MAINTENANCE phase will be assessed every 4 weeks up to 20 weeks or until AD relapse that depends on which time point comes first. If subjects don't experience relapse during MAINTENANCE phase, subsequent FOLLOW-UP phase applying emollient twice daily won't be longer than another 12 weeks.

Total study duration is up to 37 weeks. All subjects receive FP 0.05% cream twice daily up to 4 weeks to all affected sites and any newly occurring sites in ACUTE phase. After randomization in MAINTENANCE phase, subjects either receive emollient twice daily extendedly plus FP 0.05% cream once daily twice a week to all healed sites and any newly occurring sites (Group A), or emollient twice daily extendedly (Group B), up to 20 weeks. In FOLLOW-UP phase, all subjects apply emollient twice daily up to 12 weeks.

This study will enrol 120 subjects, and propose at least 80 subjects to be randomized.

IDQOL and CDLQI questionnaires were designed for infants (below the age of 4 years) and children (age 4 to age 16) with atopic dermatitis, respectively. The IDQOL and CDLQI were calculated by summing the score of each question resulting in a maximum of 30 and a minimum of 0. The higher the score in each questionnaire, the more quality of life is impaired. The change from Baseline in the QoL score is based on each questionnaire at the end of the Maintenance Phase and is calculated as the score at the end of the Maintenance Phase minus the Baseline score. Baseline is defined as QoL scores obtained at Visit 4 (end of Acute Phase).
