NCT03683719,"Phase 2b Dose-ranging Trial to Evaluate Delgocitinib Cream 1, 3, 8, and 20 mg/g Compared to Delgocitinib Cream Vehicle Over a 16-week Treatment Period in Adult Subjects With Chronic Hand Eczema",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03683719,,COMPLETED,"The purpose of this research trial was to test different strengths of a new trial medication, delgocitinib cream 1, 3, 8, and 20 mg/g, and to investigate how treatment with delgocitinib cream affects chronic hand eczema. This was judged by a range of assessments that rate the severity and extent of chronic hand eczema and its symptoms, as well as general health status and quality of life.",YES,Chronic Hand Eczema,DRUG: Delgocitinib cream|DRUG: Delgocitinib cream vehicle,"Investigator's Global Assessment for Chronic Hand Eczema (IGA-CHE) Score of 0 (Clear) or 1 (Almost Clear) With at Least a 2-step Improvement (IGA-CHE Treatment Success) From Baseline to Week 16., IGA-CHE is an instrument used in clinical trials to rate the severity of subject's global disease stage and is based on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (clear) to 4 (severe).

The multiple comparison procedure - modelling (MCP-Mod) approach was used to guide dose selection. Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel analysis was used to determine the difference in response rates between the active delgocitinib cream doses and delgocitinib cream vehicle., Week 0 to Week 16.","Change in Hand Eczema Severity Index (HECSI) From Baseline to Week 16., HECSI is an instrument used in clinical trials to rate the severity of 6 clinical signs of hand eczema and the extent of the lesions on each of 5 hand areas by use of standard scales. The total HECSI score is based on a 4-point severity scale ranging from 0 (none/absent) to 3 (severe) and a 5-point scale rating the affected area(s) ranging from 0 (0% affected area) to 4 (76% to 100% affected area). The lowest HECSI score is 0 and the highest possible is 360. A higher HECSI score is indicating more severe hand eczema.

The multiple comparison procedure - modelling (MCP-Mod) approach was used to guide dose selection. A mixed model for repeated measurements (MMRM) analysis was used to determine the difference in the continuous endpoint between the active delgocitinib cream doses and delgocitinib cream vehicle., Week 0 to Week 16.|Time to IGA-CHE Treatment Success., Time to IGA-CHE treatment success response is defined as the time from baseline to first assessment of an IGA-CHE score of 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear) with at least a 2-step improvement., Week 0 to Week 16.",,LEO Pharma,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE2,258,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: DOUBLE (PARTICIPANT, INVESTIGATOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",LP0133-1273,2018-11-28,2020-03-06,2020-04-20,2018-09-25,2021-03-23,2021-05-13,"Leo Pharma Investigational Site, Tucson, Arizona, 85724, United States|Leo Pharma Investigational Site, Hialeah, Florida, 33012, United States|Leo Pharma Investigational Site, Portland, Oregon, 97223, United States|Leo Pharma Investigational Site, Portland, Oregon, 97239-4501, United States|Leo Pharma Investigational Site, Aarhus, 8200, Denmark|Leo Pharma Investigational Site, Copenhagen, 2400, Denmark|Leo Pharma Investigational Site, Hellerup, 2900, Denmark|LEO Pharma Investigational Site, Herlev, 2730, Denmark|Leo Pharma Investigational Site, Berlin, 10117, Germany|Leo Pharma Investigational Site, Bochum, 44791, Germany|Leo Pharma Investigational Site, Bremerhaven, 27574, Germany|Leo Pharma Investigational Site, Dresden, 01307, Germany|Leo Pharma Investigational Site, Düsseldorf, 40225, Germany|Leo Pharma Investigational Site, Gera, 07548, Germany|Leo Pharma Investigational Site, Göttingen, 37075, Germany|Leo Pharma Investigational Site, Jena, 07743, Germany|Leo Pharma Investigational Site, Kiel, 24105, Germany|Leo Pharma Investigational Site, Kiel, 24148, Germany|Leo Pharma Investigational Site, Langenau, 89129, Germany|Leo Pharma Investigational Site, Lübeck, 23538, Germany|Leo Pharma Investigational Site, Mahlow, 15831, Germany|Leo Pharma Investigational Site, Mainz, 55101, Germany|Leo Pharma Investigational Site, Memmingen, 87700, Germany|Leo Pharma Investigational Site, München, 80337, Germany|Leo Pharma Investigational Site, Selters, 56242, Germany|Leo Pharma Investigational Site, Stuttgart, 70178, Germany|Leo Pharma Investigational Site, Stuttgart, 70499, Germany|Leo Pharma Investigational Site, Wuppertal, 42287, Germany","Study Protocol and Statistical Analysis Plan, https://storage.googleapis.com/ctgov2-large-docs/19/NCT03683719/Prot_SAP_000.pdf"
