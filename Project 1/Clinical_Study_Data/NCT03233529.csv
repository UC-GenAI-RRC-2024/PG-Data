NCT03233529,Crisaborole Ointment 2% Skin Biomarker Biopsy Study in Atopic Dermatitis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03233529,,COMPLETED,"This study is being conducted to characterize the mechanism of action of crisaborole ointment 2%, by evaluation of efficacy and changes in key skin biomarkers in atopic dermatitis (AD) lesions treated with crisaborole ointment 2% over vehicle, in subjects with mild to moderate AD. Two identified AD skin lesions for each subject will be treated for the first 15 days, one with crisaborole ointment 2% and one with vehicle, in a blinded manner, and biopsies for biomarker analysis will be performed on the lesions. Following completion of the blinded treatment period, subjects will start the 28 day open label period during which all AD affected skin lesions will be treated with crisaborole ointment 2% twice daily.",YES,"Dermatitis, Atopic",DRUG: Crisaborole ointment 2% BID|DRUG: Placebo ointment (vehicle),"Change From Baseline in Lesion Total Sign Score (TSS) for Target Lesions Treated With Crisaborole Ointment 2% or Vehicle at Day 15, The lesion TSS is an assessment of target lesion severity based on the severity of the following 4 clinical signs: (1) erythema, (2) induration/papulation, (3) excoriation, and (4) lichenification, each of which was rated on a scale of 0 to 3 (0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe).

SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; life-threatening (immediate risk of death); initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly/birth defect. AEs included both SAEs and non-serious AEs. Treatment-emergent AEs were those with initial onset or increasing in severity on or after the first dose of study treatment. Each participant received both crisaborole (for one target lesion) and vehicle (for the other target lesion) on the same days during double-blind period, and only crisaborole during open-label period; therefore AEs were reported for each treatment group for participants to capture all AEs, instead of each treatment for treated area as it only captures AEs occurred at treated areas (see next Outcome Measure)., From first dose of study treatment up to Day 71|Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (AEs) by Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) Preferred Term, Which Occurred in the Treatment Area During the Double-Blind Period, An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study treatment without regard to possibility of causal relationship. Treatment-emergent AEs were those with initial onset or increasing in severity on or after the first dose of study treatment. During double-blind period, there were a total of 2 treatment areas (for target lesions) for each participant. For this outcome measure, treatment-emergent AEs occurred at each treated area during double-blind period were summarized.
