NCT00717769,"A Multicenter, Randomized, Placebo-Controlled, Double-Blind Study of SUN13834 in Adult Subjects With Atopic Dermatitis",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00717769,,COMPLETED,The purpose of the study is to explore the efficacy and safety of SUN13834 vs placebo in adult participants with atopic dermatitis.,YES,Atopic Dermatitis,DRUG: SUN13834|DRUG: Placebo,"Baseline of Disease Characteristics Before Treatment With SUN13834 or Placebo in Adult Participants With Atopic Dermatitis, Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) Score is a composite index including an assessment of disease extent and percent of body surface area involved, converted to a proportional factor in 4 body regions (head and neck, lower limbs, upper limbs, and trunk). The total EASI has a minimum score of 0 (clear) and a maximum of 72 (very severe). Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) score consists of a 6-point scale from a minimum of 0 (clear) and a maximum of 6 (very severe atopic dermatitis). (0 = clear; 1 = almost clear; 2 = mild disease; 3 = moderate disease, 4 = severe disease; and 5 = very severe disease). Pruritus score consists of a 4-point scale with 0 as the minimum and 3 as the maximum (0 = absent, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe). Insomnia score is an 11-point scale, ranging from a minimum of no insomnia (score = 0) to a maximum of severe insomnia (score = 10). Higher scores indicate a worse outcome and lower scores indicate a better outcome for all scales., Pre-dose|Mean Change in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) Score From Baseline to Each Visit Following Treatment With SUN13834 or Placebo in Adult Participants With Atopic Dermatitis, EASI is an overall assessment of the disease severity of the entire body. The EASI is a composite index including an assessment of disease extent and percent of body surface area involved, converted to a proportional factor (scale of 0-6), in 4 body regions (head and neck, lower limbs, upper limbs, and trunk). The EASI also includes an assessment of erythema, induration and/or papulation, excoriation, and lichenification, each on a scale of 0 to 3. The EASI has a minimum score of 0 (clear) and a maximum of 72 (very severe). The algorithm for calculating the EASI requires, for each body region, the sum of the clinical sign scores multiplied by the area, multiplied by the proportional factor. The total EASI score is the sum of the 4 body region scores. A negative value is an indication of a decrease in individual EASI scores and eczema severity. Higher scores indicate a worse outcome and lower scores a better outcome., Day 8, Day 15, Day 22, Day 29, Follow Up Week 2 and Week 4 post-dose.|Percent Change in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) Score From Baseline to Each Visit Following Treatment With SUN13834 or Placebo in Adult Participants With Atopic Dermatitis, EASI is an overall assessment of the disease severity of the entire body.

Higher scores indicate a worse outcome and lower scores indicate a better outcome. (0 = clear; 1 = almost clear; 2 = mild disease; 3 = moderate disease, 4 = severe disease; and 5 = very severe disease)., Day 8, Day 15, Day 22, Day 29, Follow Up Week 2 and Week 4 post-dose.|Percent Change in Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) Score From Baseline to Each Visit Following Treatment With SUN13834 or Placebo in Adult Participants With Atopic Dermatitis, IGA score is used as an overall assessment of disease severity of the entire body, which consists of a 6-point scale from a minimum of 0 (clear) and a maximum of 6 (very severe atopic dermatitis).

The Pruritus score consists of a 4-point scale with 0 as the minimum and 3 as the maximum (0 = absent, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe). A lower score (0) indicates a better outcome and a higher score (3) indicates a worse outcome. A negative value indicates a decreasing change in the pruritus score.
