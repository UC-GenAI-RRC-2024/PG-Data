The scale ranges from 0 to 72 and the severity strata for the EASI are as follows: 0 clear; 0.1-1.0 almost clear; 1.1-7.0 mild; 7.1-21.0 =moderate; 21.1-50.0 severe; 50.1-72.0 very severe. When assessing response to therapy a reduction of 7 or more is considered to be clinically meaningful., EASI was measured at baseline (week 0) and 16 weeks after dosing.","Rate of Flares, over 16 weeks",,"Atopix Therapeutics, Ltd.",,ALL,ADULT,PHASE2,142,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: DOUBLE (PARTICIPANT, INVESTIGATOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",OC000459/017/13,2013-10,2015-09,2016-02,2013-12-05,2016-07-12,2018-03-26,"University of Sheffield, Sheffield, United Kingdom",
