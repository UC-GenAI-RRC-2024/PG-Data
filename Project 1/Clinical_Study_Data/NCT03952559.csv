The IGA measures the investigator's global assessment of the participant's overall severity of their Atopic Dermatitis, based on a static, numeric 5-point scale from 0 (clear skin) to 4 (severe disease). The score is based on an overall assessment of the degree of erythema, papulation/induration, oozing/crusting, and lichenification., Week 16|Open Label Population Pharmacokinetics (Pop PK): Maximum Observed Drug Concentration at Steady State (Cmax,ss) of LY3009104, Open label Pop PK: Cmax,ss was derived by a population pharmacokinetics approach., Predose; 0.25 hours (h); 0.5 h; 1 h; 2-4 h; 4 h and 4-6 h post dose|Open Label Pop PK: Area Under the Concentration-Time Curve for Dosing Interval at Steady State (AUCtau,ss) of LY3009104, Open label Pop PK: AUCtau,ss was derived by a population pharmacokinetics approach., Predose; 0.25 h; 0.5 h; 1 h; 2-4 h; 4 h and 4-6 h post dose","Percentage of Participants Achieving Eczema Area and Severity Index 75 (EASI75), The EASI assesses objective physician estimates of 2 dimensions of atopic dermatitis - disease extent and clinical signs affected: 0 = 0%; 1 = 1-9%; 2 = 10-29%; 3 = 30-49%; 4 = 50-69%; 5 = 70-89%; 6 = 90-100% and the severity of 4 clinical signs: (1) erythema, (2) edema/papulation, (3) excoriation, and (4) lichenification each on a scale of 0 to 3 (0 = none, absent; 1 = mild; 2 = moderate; 3 = severe) at 4 body sites (head/neck, trunk, upper limbs, and lower limbs). Half scores are allowed between severities 1, 2, and 3. The final EASI score was obtained by weight-averaging these 4 scores and will range from 0 to 72 (severe). The EASI75 is defined as a ≥ 75% improvement from baseline in the EASI score.

Nine questions were scored as follows: Very much = 3, Quite a lot = 2, Only a little = 1, Not at all or unanswered = 0. Question 7 has an added possible response, which was scored as 3. CDLQI equals the sum of the score of each question (max. = 30, min. = 0). Higher the score, the greater the impact on QOL. A negative change from baseline indicated improvement. LS Means were calculated using mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) model includes treatment, age cohort, region, baseline disease severity (IGA), visit, treatment-by-age cohort interaction and treatment-by-visit-interaction as fixed categorical effects and baseline and baseline-by-visit-interaction as fixed continuous effects., Baseline, Week 16|Change From Baseline in Infants' Dermatology Quality of Life Index (IDQOL) at Week 16 for Participants 2 to <4 Years at Study Entry, Infants' Dermatitis Quality of Life Index (IDQOL) is used to evaluate quality of life for subjects of age less than 4 years. IDQOL questionnaires were designed for infants (below the age of 4 years) with atopic dermatitis. The IDQOL was calculated by summing the score of each question resulting in a maximum of 30 and a minimum of 0. The higher the score in each questionnaire, the more quality of life is impaired. A negative change from baseline indicated improvement. LS Means were calculated using mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) model includes treatment, age cohort, region, baseline disease severity (IGA), visit, treatment-by-age cohort interaction and treatment-by-visit-interaction as fixed categorical effects and baseline and baseline-by-visit-interaction as fixed continuous effects., Week 16|Change From Baseline on the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment: Atopic Dermatitis - Caregiver (WPAI-AD-CG) Score, The Atopic Dermatitis Caregiver (WPAI-AD-CG) assesses the effect of a child's atopic dermatitis on the parent/caregiver's work productivity during the past 7 days. The WPAI-AD consists of 6 items grouped in 4 domains: absenteeism (work time missed), presenteeism (impairment at work/reduced on-the-job effectiveness), work productivity loss (overall work impairment/absenteeism plus presenteeism), and activity impairment, that range from 0% to 100%, Scores are calculated as impairment percentages with higher scores indicating greater impairment and less productivity.

LS Mean were calculated using a MMRM model with treatment, baseline disease severity (IGA), visit, and treatment-by-visit-interaction as fixed categorical effects and baseline and baseline-by-visit-interaction as fixed continuous effects., Baseline, Week 16|Change From Baseline on the European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions-Youth (EQ-5D-Y) for Participants 4 to <18 Years at Study Entry, The EQ-5D-Y questionnaire is health status related and self-completed for pediatric participants ≥8 years old and completed by parents/caregivers for children 4 to \<8 years old. Health state profile assessed health in 5 dimensions (Mobility,selfcare,usual activities,pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression) to obtain index score, each with three levels of response (no problems,some problems,a lot of problems). Participants indicated their health state by choosing appropriate level from each dimension. Visual analog scale on which participant rates their perceived health state from 0 (""worst health you can imagine"") to 100 (""best health you can imagine"") is presented.Higher the score the better the health status.

Item 2, frequency of waking last night is reported by selecting the number of times they woke up each night, ranging from 0 to 29 times, where the higher a number indicates a worse outcome. The ADSS is designed to be completed daily, using a daily diary, with respondents thinking about sleep ""last night."" Each item is scored individually.
