The score is based on an overall assessment of the degree of erythema, papulation/induration, oozing/crusting, and lichenification., Week 16","Percentage of Participants Achieving Eczema Area and Severity Index 75 (EASI75), The EASI assesses objective physician estimates of 2 dimensions of atopic dermatitis - disease extent and clinical signs affected: 0 = 0%; 1 = 1-9%; 2 = 10-29%; 3 = 30-49%; 4 = 50-69%; 5 = 70-89%; 6 = 90-100% and the severity of 4 clinical signs: (1) erythema, (2) edema/papulation, (3) excoriation, and (4) lichenification each on a scale of 0 to 3 (0 = none, absent; 1 = mild; 2 = moderate; 3 = severe) at 4 body sites (head/neck, trunk, upper limbs, and lower limbs). Half scores are allowed between severities 1, 2, and 3. The final EASI score was obtained by weight-averaging these 4 scores and will range from 0 to 72 (severe). The EASI75 is defined as a ≥ 75% improvement from baseline in the EASI score., Week 16|Percentage of Participants Achieving EASI90, The EASI assesses objective physician estimates of 2 dimensions of atopic dermatitis - disease extent and clinical signs affected: 0 = 0%; 1 = 1-9%; 2 = 10-29%; 3 = 30-49%; 4 = 50-69%; 5 = 70-89%; 6 = 90-100% and the severity of 4 clinical signs: (1) erythema, (2) edema/papulation, (3) excoriation, and (4) lichenification each on a scale of 0 to 3 (0 = none, absent; 1 = mild; 2 = moderate; 3 = severe) at 4 body sites (head/neck, trunk, upper limbs, and lower limbs). Half scores are allowed between severities 1, 2, and 3. The final EASI score was obtained by weight-averaging these 4 scores and will range from 0 to 72 (severe). The EASI90 is defined as a ≥ 90% improvement from baseline in the EASI score., Week 16|Percent Change From Baseline on EASI Score, The EASI assesses objective physician estimates of 2 dimensions of atopic dermatitis - disease extent and clinical signs affected: 0 = 0%; 1 = 1-9%; 2 = 10-29%; 3 = 30-49%; 4 = 50-69%; 5 = 70-89%; 6 = 90-100% and the severity of 4 clinical signs: (1) erythema, (2) edema/papulation, (3) excoriation, and (4) lichenification each on a scale of 0 to 3 (0 = none, absent; 1 = mild; 2 = moderate; 3 = severe) at 4 body sites (head/neck, trunk, upper limbs, and lower limbs). Half scores are allowed between severities 1, 2, and 3. The final EASI score was obtained by weight-averaging these 4 scores and will range from 0 to 72 (severe).

Least Squares Mean (LSM) were calculated using mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) with treatment, region, baseline disease severity (IGA), visit, and treatment-by-visit interaction as fixed categorical effects and baseline score and baseline score-by-visit interaction as fixed continuous effects., Baseline, Week 16|Percentage of Participants Achieving SCORing Atopic Dermatitis 75 (SCORAD75), The SCORAD index uses the rule of nines to assess disease extent and evaluates 6 clinical characteristics to determine disease severity: (1) erythema, (2) edema/papulation, (3)oozing/crusts, (4) excoriation, (5) lichenification, and (6) dryness on a scale of 0 to 3 (0=absence, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe). The SCORAD index also assesses subjective symptoms of pruritus and sleep loss with a visual analogue scales (VAS) where 0 is no itching or no trouble sleeping and 10 is unbearable itching or a lot of trouble sleeping. These 3 aspects: extent of disease (A: 0-1-2), disease severity (B: 0-18), \& subjective symptoms (C: 0-20) combine using A/5 + 7\*B/2+ C to give a maximum possible score of 103, where 0 = no disease and 103 = severe disease. The SCORAD75 responder is defined as a participant who achieves a ≥ 75% improvement from baseline in the SCORAD score., Week 16|Percentage of Participants Achieving a 4-Point Improvement in Itch Numeric Rating Scale (NRS), The Itch NRS is a patient-administered, 11-point horizontal scale anchored at 0 and 10, with 0 representing ""no itch"" and 10 representing ""worst itch imaginable."" Overall severity of a participant's itching is indicated by selecting the number, using a daily diary, that best describes the worst level of itching in the past 24 hours., Week 16|Change From Baseline in the Score of Item 2 of the Atopic Dermatitis Sleep Scale (ADSS), The ADSS is a 3-item, participant-administered questionnaire developed to assess the impact of itch on sleep including difficulty falling asleep due to itch, frequency of waking due to itch, and difficulty getting back to sleep last night due to itch. Item 2 frequency of waking last night is reported by selecting the number of times they woke up each night, ranging from 0 to 29 times, where the higher a number indicates a worse outcome.

The SCORAD90 is defined as a ≥ 90% improvement from baseline in the SCORAD score., Week 16|Change From Baseline in Body Surface Area (BSA) Affected, The BSA affected by AD will be assessed for 4 separate body regions and is collected as part of the EASI assessment: head and neck, trunk (including genital region), upper extremities, and lower extremities (including the buttocks). Each body region will be assessed for disease extent ranging from 0% to 100% involvement. The overall total percentage will be reported based off of all 4 body regions combined, after applying specific multipliers to the different body regions to account for the percent of the total BSA represented by each of the 4 regions. Use the percentage of skin affected for each region (0 to 100%) in EASI as follows: BSA Total = 0.1\*BSAhead and neck + 0.3\*BSAtrunk + 0.2\* BSAupper limbs + 0.4\*BSAlower limbs.
