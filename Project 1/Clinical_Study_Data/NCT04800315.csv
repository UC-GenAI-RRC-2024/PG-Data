NCT04800315,A Study to Evaluate Safety and Effectiveness of Cendakimab (CC-93538) in Participants With Moderate to Severe Atopic Dermatitis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04800315,,COMPLETED,The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of 3 dose regimen of CC-93538 in adult participants with moderate to severe Atopic Dermatitis (AD).,YES,"Dermatitis, Atopic|Eczema",DRUG: CC-93538|OTHER: Placebo,"Mean Percentage Change From Baseline in EASI at Week 16, The Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) is a composite scoring system assessed by the Investigator based on the proportion of each of the 4 body regions (head and neck, upper limbs, lower limbs, and trunk) affected with Atopic Dermatitis (AD) and the intensity of each of 4 main signs of AD (eg, erythema, induration/papulation, excoriation, and lichenification) and is based on a 4-point scale of 0 (none), 1 (mild), 2 (moderate), and 3 (severe). The sum of the scores is totaled (0 to 72), the lower the score the better., From initial EASI measurement to week 16","Percentage of Responders With an vIGA-AD Score of 0 (Clear) or 1 (Almost Clear) and a Reduction ≥ 2 Points From Baseline at Week 16, The Validated Investigator Global Assessment (vIGA-AD) is a validated 5-point assessment intended to assess the global severities of key acute clinical signs of AD, including erythema, induration/papulation, oozing/crusting (lichenification excluded). The rating of clear (0), almost clear (1), mild (2), moderate (3) and severe (4), will be assessed at scheduled visits. The vIGA-AD must be conducted before the EASI assessment. The vIGA-AD is a static evaluation conducted without regard to the score obtained at a previous visit.

Percentage of responders calculated using Multiple Imputation (MI) approach.

For participants discontinued study drug, whose vIGA-AD response at Week 16 are missing or cannot be adequately determined (including missing due to COVID-19) without use of rescue therapy/prohibited medication prior to Week 16, their outcomes will be handled using a MI approach assuming missing at random (MAR)., From initial vIGA-AD assessment to week 16|Percentage of EASI-75 Responders at Week 16, The EASI is a composite scoring system assessed by the Investigator based on the proportion of each of the 4 body regions (head and neck, upper limbs, lower limbs, and trunk) affected with AD and the intensity of each of 4 main signs of AD (eg, erythema, induration/papulation, excoriation, and lichenification) and is based on a 4-point scale of 0 (none), 1 (mild), 2 (moderate), and 3 (severe). The sum of the scores is totaled (0 to 72), the lower the score the better.

For participants discontinued study drug, whose EASI-75 response at Week 16 are missing or cannot be adequately determined (including missing due to COVID-19) without use of rescue therapy/prohibited medication prior to Week 16, their outcomes will be handled using a MI approach assuming missing at random (MAR)., From initial EASI measurement to week 16|Percentage of EASI-90 Responders at Week 16, The Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) is a composite scoring system assessed by the Investigator based on the proportion of each of the 4 body regions (head and neck, upper limbs, lower limbs, and trunk) affected with Atopic Dermatitis (AD) and the intensity of each of 4 main signs of AD (eg, erythema, induration/papulation, excoriation, and lichenification) and is based on a 4-point scale of 0 (none), 1 (mild), 2 (moderate), and 3 (severe). The sum of the scores is totaled (0 to 72), the lower the score the better.

Percentage of responders calculated using Multiple Imputation (MI) approach.

For participants discontinued study drug, whose EASI-90 response at Week 16 are missing or cannot be adequately determined (including missing due to COVID-19) without use of rescue therapy/prohibited medication prior to Week 16, their outcomes will be handled using a MI approach assuming missing at random (MAR)., From initial EASI measurement to week 16|Percent Change in Mean SCORAD Scores From Baseline at Week 16, The SCORAD is a validated scoring index for atopic dermatitis, which combines extent (0 to 100), severity (0 to 18), and subjective symptoms (0 to 20) based on pruritus and sleep loss, each scored (0 to 10). The subject will assess the subjective symptoms (itch and sleepless) part of the assessment.

SCORing Atopic Dermatitis Index (SCORAD) score ranges from 0 to 103, higher scores indicate more severe disease., From initial SCORAD measurement to week 16|Percent Change From Baseline in Pruritus NRS at Week 16, Pruritus will be assessed by the subject using the Pruritus NRS, which was developed and validated as a single item, patient reported outcome (PRO) of itch severity. Clinical response is indicated by a ≥ 2 to 4-point change from baseline in Peak Pruritus NRS score. The intensity of pruritus will be assessed based on last 24 hours using a validated 11-point NRS, ranging from 0 (""no pruritus"") to 10 (""the worst pruritus imaginable"")., From initial NRS measurement to week 16|Percentage of Participants With a Response and Pruritus NRS Change of ≥ 4 Points From Baseline at Week 16, Pruritus will be assessed by the subject using the Pruritus NRS, which was developed and validated as a single item, patient reported outcome (PRO) of itch severity. Clinical response is indicated by a ≥ 2 to 4-point change from baseline in Peak Pruritus NRS score. The intensity of pruritus will be assessed based on last 24 hours using a validated 11-point NRS, ranging from 0 (""no pruritus"") to 10 (""the worst pruritus imaginable"").

For participants discontinued study drug, whose pruritus NRS response at Week 16 are missing or cannot be adequately determined (including missing due to COVID-19) without use of rescue therapy/prohibited medication prior to Week 16, their outcomes will be handled using a MI approach assuming missing at random (MAR)., From initial NRS assessment to week 16|Time to Achieve at Least 4 Points of Improvement in the Severity of Pruritus NRS Scale., Pruritus will be assessed by the subject using the Pruritus NRS, which was developed and validated as a single item, patient reported outcome (PRO) of itch severity. Clinical response is indicated by a ≥ 2 to 4-point change from baseline in Peak Pruritus NRS score. The intensity of pruritus will be assessed based on last 24 hours using a validated 11-point NRS, ranging from 0 (""no pruritus"") to 10 (""the worst pruritus imaginable"")., From initial NRS pruritus response up to study day 127 (127 days)|Adjust Mean Percentage Change in BSA in Atopic Dermatitis From Baseline at Week 16, Body Surface Area involvement will be calculated from the sum of the number of handprints of skin afflicted with atopic dermatitis in a body region. The number of handprints of skin afflicted with atopic dermatitis in a body region can be used to determine the extent (%) to which a body region is involved with AD. When measuring, the handprint unit refers to the size of each individual subject's hand with fingers in a closed position. BSA will be calculated by the Investigator or qualified designee using the 1% handprint rule, in which the area represented by the palm with all 5 digits adducted together is approximately 1% of the subject's BSA., From initial BSA assessment to week 16|Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events, Treatment emergent adverse events, From first treatment to the end of follow up, approximately 32 weeks|Number of Participants With the Presence of Serum Antibodies to CC-93538, From first treatment to the end of follow up, approximately 32 weeks|Serum Trough Concentration at Week 16, A serum trough concentration (Ctrough) is the concentration reached by a drug immediately before the next dose is administered.
