NCT02576938,A Study of Baricitinib (LY3009104) in Participants With Moderate-to-Severe Atopic Dermatitis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02576938,,COMPLETED,The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Baricitinib in eczema.,YES,Atopic Dermatitis,DRUG: Baricitinib|DRUG: Placebo|DRUG: Triamcinolone (Optional),"Percentage of Participants With a 50% or Greater Reduction in the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI 50), The EASI 50, defined as â‰¥ 50% reduction from baseline in EASI score, assesses extent of disease based on dividing the skin into 4 regions (head/neck, trunk, upper limbs, and lower limbs) and measures the following clinical signs: (1) erythema, (2) edema/papulation, (3) excoriation, and (4) lichenification each on a scale of 0 to 3.The EASI confers a maximum score of 72 with 0 = clear; 0.1 -1 = almost clear; 1.1 -7 = mild; 7.1 - 21 = moderate; 21.1 - 50 = severe; 50.1 - 72 = very severe., Week 16","Change From Baseline in the EASI at Week 16, The Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) assesses extent of disease based on dividing the skin into 4 regions (head/neck, trunk, upper limbs, and lower limbs) and measures the following clinical signs: (1) erythema, (2) edema/papulation, (3) excoriation, and (4) lichenification each on a scale of 0 to 3.The EASI confers a maximum score of 72 with 0 = clear; 0.1 -1 = almost clear; 1.1 -7 = mild; 7.1 - 21 = moderate; 21.1 - 50 = severe; 50.1 - 72 = very severe. Change from baseline were analyzed with a Mixed-effect Model Repeated Measure (MMRM) with fixed effects for treatment, visit, country, and the treatment-by-visit interaction, plus baseline and baseline-by-visit included as covariates., Baseline, Week 16|Percentage Change From Baseline in the EASI at Week 16, The Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) assesses extent of disease based on dividing the skin into 4 regions (head/neck, trunk, upper limbs, and lower limbs) and measures the following clinical signs: (1) erythema, (2) edema/papulation, (3) excoriation, and (4) lichenification each on a scale of 0 to 3.The EASI confers a maximum score of 72 with 0 = clear; 0.1 -1 = almost clear; 1.1 -7 = mild; 7.1 - 21 = moderate; 21.1 - 50 = severe; 50.1 - 72 = very severe. Changes from baseline were analyzed with an MMRM with fixed effects for treatment, visit, country, and the treatment-by-visit interaction, plus baseline and baseline-by-visit included as covariates., Baseline, Week 16|Change From Baseline in the Scoring Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) at Week 16, The SCORAD index uses the rule of nines to assess disease extent and evaluates five clinical characteristics to determine disease severity: (1) erythema, (2) edema/papulation, (3) oozing/crusts, (4) excoriation and (5) lichenification. SCORAD also assesses subjective symptoms of pruritus and sleep loss with Visual Analogue Scales (VAS) where 0 is no itch (or sleeplessness) and 10 is the worst imaginable itch (or sleeplessness). These three aspects: extent of disease (A: 0-102), disease severity (B: 0-18) and subjective symptoms (C:0-20) combine using A/5 + 7\*B/2+ C to give a maximum possible score of 103 where 0 = no disease and 103 = severe disease. Changes from baseline were analyzed with an MMRM with fixed effects for treatment, visit, country, and the treatment-by-visit interaction, plus baseline and baseline-by-visit included as covariates., Baseline, Week 16|Change From Baseline in the Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) at Week 16, The IGA consists of a 6-point severity scale to measure characteristics of erythema, infiltration, papulation, oozing and crusting as guidelines for the overall severity assessment. The scale ranges from clear to very severe disease (0 = clear, 1 = almost clear, 2 = mild disease, 3 = moderate disease, 4 = severe disease and 5 = very severe disease)., Baseline, Week 16|Change From Baseline in the Dermatologic Life Quality Index (DLQI) at Week 16, The DLQI is a simple, participant-administered, 10-question, validated, quality-of-life questionnaire that covers 6 domains including symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure, work and school, personal relationships, and treatment. Response categories include ""Not at all,"" ""A little,"" ""A lot,"" and ""Very much,"" with corresponding scores of 0, 1, 2, and 3 respectively. Questions 3-10 also have an additional response category of ""Not relevant"" which is scored as ""0"". For all questions, if unanswered the question is scored as ""0"". Totals range from 0 to 30 (less to more impairment). Changes from baseline in DLQI score were analyzed with an MMRM with fixed effects for treatment, time, country, and the treatment-by-visit interaction, plus baseline and baseline-by-visit were included as covariates., Baseline, Week 16|Change From Baseline in the Itch Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) at Week 16, The Itch NRS is a participant-administered, 11-point horizontal scale anchored at 0 and 10, with 0 representing ""no itch"" and 10 representing ""worst itch imaginable."" Overall severity of a participant's itching is indicated by circling the number that best describes the worst level of itching in the past 24 hours. Changes from baseline were analyzed with an MMRM with fixed effects for treatment, time, country, and the treatment-by-visit interaction, plus baseline and baseline-by-visit were included as covariates., Baseline, Week 16|Pharmacokinetics (PK): Maximum Serum Concentration (Cmax) of Baricitinib, Pharmacokinetics (PK): Maximum serum concentration (Cmax) of Baricitinib, Week (Wk) 0: Predose, 15-30 minutes (min) postdose; Wk 4: 1.5 - 4 hour (hr) postdose; Wk 8: 4 - 8 hr postdose; Wk 12: Predose; Wk 16: 30 - 90 min postdose.",,Eli Lilly and Company,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE2,124,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: DOUBLE (PARTICIPANT, INVESTIGATOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",16284|I4V-MC-JAHG,2016-02,2017-02,2017-03,2015-10-15,2018-02-16,2020-06-17,"Dermatology Research Associates, Los Angeles, California, 90045, United States|Forward Clinical Trials, Inc, Tampa, Florida, 33624, United States|Medical Dermatology Specialists, Atlanta, Georgia, 30342, United States|Northwestern University, Chicago, Illinois, 60611, United States|Icahn School of Medicine, New York, New York, 10029, United States|Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, Oregon, 97239, United States|Menter Dermatology Research Institute, Dallas, Texas, 75246, United States|Center for Clinical Studies, Houston, Texas, 77004, United States|Center for Clinical Studies, Houston, Texas, 77065, United States|Center for Clinical Studies, Webster, Texas, 77598, United States|For additional information regarding investigative sites for this trial, contact 1-877-CTLILLY (1-877-285-4559, 1-317-615-4559) Mon - Fri from 9 AM to 5 PM Eastern Time (UTC/GMT - 5 hours, EST), or speak with your personal physician., Fukuoka-shi, 815-0082, Japan|For additional information regarding investigative sites for this trial, contact 1-877-CTLILLY (1-877-285-4559, 1-317-615-4559) Mon - Fri from 9 AM to 5 PM Eastern Time (UTC/GMT - 5 hours, EST), or speak with your personal physician., Sapporo, 060-0063, Japan|For additional information regarding investigative sites for this trial, contact 1-877-CTLILLY (1-877-285-4559, 1-317-615-4559) Mon - Fri from 9 AM to 5 PM Eastern Time (UTC/GMT - 5 hours, EST), or speak with your personal physician, Takaoka-shi, 933-0871, Japan","Statistical Analysis Plan, https://storage.googleapis.com/ctgov2-large-docs/38/NCT02576938/SAP_000.pdf|Study Protocol: Protocol, https://storage.googleapis.com/ctgov2-large-docs/38/NCT02576938/Prot_001.pdf|Study Protocol: Protocol Amendment (a), https://storage.googleapis.com/ctgov2-large-docs/38/NCT02576938/Prot_002.pdf|Study Protocol: Protocol Amendment (b), https://storage.googleapis.com/ctgov2-large-docs/38/NCT02576938/Prot_003.pdf|Study Protocol: Protocol Amendment (c), https://storage.googleapis.com/ctgov2-large-docs/38/NCT02576938/Prot_004.pdf|Study Protocol: Protocol Amendment (d), https://storage.googleapis.com/ctgov2-large-docs/38/NCT02576938/Prot_005.pdf"
