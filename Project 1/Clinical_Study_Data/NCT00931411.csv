NCT00931411,Tolerance and Efficacy of Formulation 609580 20 Versus Formulation 609209 in Children With Atopic Dermatitis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00931411,,TERMINATED,"Atopic dermatitis is one of the most frequent skin diseases. The disease is often worst during winter months when the skin is drier. Mild to moderate cases of atopic dermatitis are often controlled by a moisturizer alone. The use of moisturizers has been shown to have beneficial effects on atopic dermatitis. It can break the dry skin cycle by hydrating the upper layer of the skin which may prevent the recurrence of the disease and can reduce the use of cream or ointment medications such as corticosteroids. Formulation 609580 20 was developed to keep the moisturizing efficacy of formulation 609209 but to improve its tolerance and cosmetic acceptability (easier to apply, nicer texture, etc.). The new formulation contains the same quantity of shea butter and glycerin but in a different excipient (inactive substance) than the commercial product. In addition, vitamin B3 was added to see if it could help in reducing itching.

The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of two study products in children with atopic dermatitis. One of the study products (formulation 609580 20) is not commercially available (outside of clinical trials such as this one). The other study product (formulation 609209) has been approved in Canada and is currently available commercially under the trade name Lipikar Baume.

For this study the child will be randomly assigned to one of the following two groups:

* Group 1: 50 children will receive formulation 609209, the commercial formula for 42 days and will receive formulation 609580 20, the new formula, for 14 days.
* Group 2: 50 children will receive formulation 609580 20, the new formula, for 42 days and will receive formulation 609209, the commercial formula, for 14 days.",YES,Atopic Dermatitis,OTHER: Formulation 609580 20|OTHER: Formulation 609209 (Lipikar Baume),"Mean Percent Change in SCORAD (Scoring Atopic Dermatitis) From Day 0, The efficacy of formulation 609580 20 to provide relief to children with atopic dermatitis compared to formulation 609209 as measured by the changes in SCORAD at Day 7 and Day 42. It measures intensity of erythema/darkening, edema/papulation, oozing/crust, excoriation, lichenfinication/prurigo and dryness on a scale from 0-3 for a total of 18 points. This score is multiplided by 3.5 and added to 1/5 of the affected percent body surface area. The final score is added to the score from a 10-point pruritus visual analog scale (VAS) and a 10-point loss of sleep VAS. Best score is 0, worst is 103., 7 , 42 days","Change in Mean Global Efficacy (by Investigator)., The efficacy of formulation 609580 20 to provide relief to children with atopic dermatitis compared to formulation 609209 as measured by the global efficacy evaluation scale at Day 7 and Day 42 (by investigator).

The 14 Days after the crossover is the same as Day 56 in the study., 14 days (Day 42 to Day 56 of the study)|Change in Tolerance Before Crossover, Tolerance of study products assessed by investigator at Day 7, 42. It was evaluated using the following scale:

* 1) Very good tolerance: no objective or subjective intolerance during the study
* 2) Good tolerance: very occasional symptoms, not resulting in cessation of applications, no objective sign
* 3) Average tolerance: repeated symptoms of intolerance, no cessation of application and no objective sign
* 4) Poor tolerance: symptoms requiring cessation of application, no objective sign
* 5) Very poor tolerance: objective signs of irritative or allergic dermatitis, 7, 42 days|Change in Mean Tolerance After Crossover, Tolerance of study products assessed by investigator during the 2 weeks following the crossover (Day 56 of the study):
