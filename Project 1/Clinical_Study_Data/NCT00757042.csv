NCT00757042,Safety Study of Tezepelumab (AMG 157) in Healthy Adults and Adults With Atopic Dermatitis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00757042,,COMPLETED,"This study is a single dose escalation study of tezepelumab (AMG 157) in healthy adults (Part A) and adults with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis (Part B). The purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, immunogenicity and pharmacokinetics of tezepelumab.",YES,Atopic Dermatitis|Healthy Volunteers,DRUG: Tezepelumab|DRUG: Placebo,"Number of Participants With Adverse Events, Adverse events (AEs) include any untoward medical occurrence in a trial participant administered a study drug and does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. AEs include worsening of a pre-existing medical condition and laboratory value changes requiring therapy or adjustment in prior therapy.

AEs were assessed for severity according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 3, where Grade 1 = Mild AE, Grade 2 = Moderate AE, Grade 3 = severe AE, Grade 4 = life-threatening AE and Grade 5 = death due to AE.

Relationship to study treatment was determined by the investigator.

A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as an AE that met 1 or more of below criteria:

* was fatal;
* was life threatening;
* required in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization;
* resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity;
* was a congenital anomaly/birth defect;
* other significant medical hazard., For Part A Tezepelumab/Placebo 2.1 mg, 7 mg, 21 mg, 70 mg, and 210 mg SC: 85 days.

The index involves an assessment of the average intensity of 4 clinical signs (erythema, infiltration/papulation, excoriations, and lichenification) at 4 body areas (head/neck, upper extremities, trunk, lower extremities) assessed on a scale: 0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe.

The percent of affected area for each of the 4 body areas is also assessed using the following 6-point scale: 0 = 0%, 1 = \< 10%, 2 =10% to 29%, 3 = 30% to 49%, 4 = 50% to 69%, 5 = 70% to 89%, 6 = 90% to 100%. The total score for each body region is obtained by multiplying the sum of the severity scores of the 4 clinical signs by the area score, with adjustment for the proportion of the body region to the whole body.
