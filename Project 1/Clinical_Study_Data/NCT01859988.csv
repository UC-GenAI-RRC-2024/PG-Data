NCT01859988,Study of Dupilumab Administered to Adult Patients With Moderate-to-Severe Atopic Dermatitis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01859988,,COMPLETED,"To assess the efficacy of multiple dupilumab dose-regimens, compared to placebo, in adult participants with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD).",YES,Atopic Dermatitis,DRUG: Dupilumab|DRUG: Placebo,"Percent Change in Eczema Area and Severity Index Score (EASI) From Baseline to Week 16, The EASI score was used to measure the severity and extent of atopic dermatitis (AD) and measures erythema, infiltration, excoriation and lichenification on 4 anatomic regions of the body: head, trunk, upper and lower extremities. The total EASI score range from 0 (minimum) to 72 (maximum) points, with the higher scores reflecting the worse severity of AD., Baseline to Week 16","Percentage of Participants Who Achieved Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) Response at Week 16, IGA is an assessment scale used to determine severity of AD and clinical response to treatment on a static 5-point scale (0 = clear; 1 = almost clear; 2 = mild; 3 = moderate; 4 = severe) based on erythema and papulation/infiltration. Therapeutic response is an IGA score of 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear). Values after first rescue medication were set to missing and participants with missing IGA score at Week 16 were treated as a non-responders., Week 16|Percentage of Participants Who Achieved IGA Score Reduction of ≥2 at Week 16, IGA is an assessment scale used to determine severity of AD and clinical response to treatment on a 5-point scale (0 = clear; 1 = almost clear; 2 = mild; 3 = moderate; 4 = severe) based on erythema and papulation/infiltration. Therapeutic success is an IGA score of 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear). Participants with IGA score reduction from baseline of ≥2 points at Week 16 were reported. Values after first rescue medication were set to missing and participants with missing IGA score at Week 16 were treated as a non-responders., Week 16|Percent Change in Peak Weekly Averaged Pruritus Numerical Rating Scores (NRS) From Baseline to Week 16, Pruritus NRS is an assessment tool that is used to report the intensity of participant's pruritus (itch), both maximum and average intensity, during a 24-hour recall period. Participants were asked the following question: how would a participant rate his itch at the worst moment during the previous 24 hours (for maximum itch intensity on a scale of 0 - 10 \[0 = no itch; 10 = worst itch imaginable\])., Baseline to Week 16|Absolute Change in Peak Weekly Averaged Pruritus NRS From Baseline to Week 16, Pruritus NRS is an assessment tool that is used to report the intensity of participant's pruritus (itch), both maximum and average intensity, during a 24-hour recall period. Participants were asked the following question: how would a participant rate his itch at the worst moment during the previous 24 hours (for maximum itch intensity on a scale of 0 - 10 \[0 = no itch; 10 = worst itch imaginable\])., Baseline to Week 16|Absolute Change in EASI Score From Baseline to Week 16, The EASI score was used to measure the severity and extent of atopic dermatitis (AD) and measures erythema, infiltration, excoriation and lichenification on 4 anatomic regions of the body: head, trunk, upper and lower extremities. The total EASI score range from 0 (minimum) to 72 (maximum) points, with the higher scores reflecting the worse severity of AD., Baseline to Week 16|Percent Change in SCORing Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) Scores From Baseline to Week 16, SCORAD is a clinical tool for assessing the severity of AD developed by the European Task Force on Atopic Dermatitis (Severity scoring of atopic dermatitis: the SCORAD index). Consensus Report of the European Task Force on Atopic Dermatitis. Dermatology (Basel) 186 (1): 23-31. 1993. Extent and intensity of eczema as well as subjective signs (insomnia, etc.) are assessed and scored. Total score ranges from 0 (absent disease) to 103 (severe disease)., Baseline to Week 16|Absolute Change in SCORAD Scores From Baseline to Week 16, SCORAD is a clinical tool for assessing the severity of AD developed by the European Task Force on Atopic Dermatitis (Severity scoring of atopic dermatitis: the SCORAD index). Consensus Report of the European Task Force on Atopic Dermatitis. Dermatology (Basel) 186 (1): 23-31. 1993. Extent and intensity of eczema as well as subjective signs (insomnia, etc.) are assessed and scored. Total score ranges from 0 (absent disease) to 103 (severe disease)., Baseline to Week 16|Percentage of Participants Who Achieved 50%, 75% and 90% Reduction From Baseline in EASI Score (EASI-50, EASI-75 and EASI-90 Respectively) at Week 16, The EASI score was used to measure the severity and extent of atopic dermatitis (AD) and measures erythema, infiltration, excoriation and lichenification on 4 anatomic regions of the body: head, trunk, upper and lower extremities. The total EASI score range from 0 (minimum) to 72 (maximum) points, with the higher scores reflecting the worse severity of AD. EASI-50, EASI-75 and EASI-90 responders were the participants who achieved ≥50%, ≥75% and ≥90% overall improvement in EASI score respectively from baseline to Week 16., Week 16|Percentage of Participants Who Achieved 50%, 75% and 90% Reduction From Baseline in SCORAD Score (SCORAD-50, SCORAD-75 and SCORAD-90 Respectively) at Week 16, SCORAD is a clinical tool for assessing the severity of AD developed by the European Task Force on Atopic Dermatitis (Severity scoring of atopic dermatitis: the SCORAD index).

Total score ranges from 0 (absent disease) to 12 (severe disease)., Baseline to Week 16|Changes in GISS Cumulative Score From Baseline to Week 16, Individual components of the AD lesions (erythema, infiltration/papulation, excoriations, and lichenification) were rated globally (each assessed for the whole body, not by anatomical region) on a 4-point scale (0 = none,1 = mild, 2 = moderate and 3 = severe) using the EASI severity grading criteria.
