NCT01945086,A Study of Ustekinumab (STELARAÂ®) in Adult Japanese Participants With Severe Atopic Dermatitis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01945086,,COMPLETED,The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and effectiveness of 2 doses of ustekinumab compared with placebo (inactive medication) in adult Japanese participants with severe atopic dermatitis.,YES,"Dermatitis, Atopic",DRUG: Ustekinumab|DRUG: Placebo|OTHER: Concomitant topical medications for atopic dermatitis,"Percent Change in Eczema Area Severity Index (EASI) Total Score From Baseline at Week 12, The EASI score was used to measure the severity and extent of atopic dermatitis (AD) and measures erythema (E), infiltration (I), excoriation (Ex) and lichenification (L) on a scale of 0 (none) to 3 (severe) on 4 anatomic regions of the body: head, trunk, upper limbs, and lower limbs. Degree of involvement on each of the 4 anatomic regions is scored on a scale of 0 (no eruption) to 6 (greater than \[\>\] 90 percent \[%\]-100% eruption). The total score is the sum of the four body-region scores, maximum=72, minimum=0, with higher scores reflecting greater disease severity. The total qualitative score is multiplied by the degree of involvement for each anatomic region and then multiplied by a constant and summed to yield the EASI score., Baseline and Week 12","Number of Participants With an Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) Score of ""Clear"" or ""Almost Clear"" at Week 12, The IGA utilizes a 6-point scale ranging from 0 (clear) to 5 (very severe disease) where 0 = clear, 1 = almost clear, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate, 4 = severe and 5 (very severe disease)., Week 12|Change From Baseline in Atopic Dermatitis Itch Scale (ADIS) at Week 12, The atopic dermatitis itch scale (ADIS) will be used to assess pruritus (itching) among participants with AD. It will be evaluated by participant diary kept twice daily,in the morning(morning daily score\[MDS\]) and evening (Evening Daily Score\[EDS\]). The start-of-day item set consists of 4 items:itching at time of completing morning diary(Q1),presence of itching during night before(Q2), itching at its worst at night (Q3), and impact of itching on sleep at night(Q4). Appropriate items are summed to yield total score ranging from 0=minimum to 23=maximum, with higher scores reflecting greater itching. The end-of day item set also consists of 4 items: itching at time of completing the evening diary(Q1),the presence of itching during the day(Q2),itching at its worst during the day(Q3),and amount of time the participant experienced eczema-related itching(Q4). Appropriate items are summed to yield total score ranging from 0=minimum to 24=maximum,with higher scores reflecting greater itching., Baseline and Week 12|Change From Baseline in Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) Total Score at Week 12, The DLQI is a dermatology-specific quality of life (QOL) instrument designed to assess impact of disease on a participants QOL. It is a 10-item questionnaire that, in addition to evaluating overall, QOL can be used to assess 6 different aspects: symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure, work or school performance, personal relationships and treatment. Questions scored on a 4-point Likert scale: 0 (not relevant), 1 (a little), 2 (a lot), and 3 (very much). Scores of individual items (0-3) were added to yield a total score (0-30); higher score = greater impairment of participants QOL., Baseline and Week 12|Number of Participants With Greater Than or Equal to (>=) 50 Percent (%) and >=75% Decrease in EASI Total Score From Baseline, The EASI score was used to measure the severity and extent of AD and measures erythema (E), infiltration (I), excoriation (Ex) and lichenification (L) on a scale of 0 (none) to 3 (severe) on 4 anatomic regions of the body: head, trunk, upper limbs, and lower limbs. Degree of involvement on each of the 4 anatomic regions is scored on a scale of 0 (no eruption) to 6 (greater than \[\>\] 90%-100% eruption). The total score is the sum of the four body-region scores, maximum=72, minimum=0, with higher scores reflecting greater disease severity. The total qualitative score is multiplied by the degree of involvement for each anatomic region and then multiplied by a constant and summed to yield the EASI score., Week 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24|Number of Participants With an IGA Score of ""Clear"" or ""Almost Clear"", The IGA utilizes a 6-point scale ranging from 0 (clear) to 5 (very severe disease) where 0 = clear, 1 = almost clear, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate, 4 = severe and 5 (very severe disease)., Baseline, Week 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24|Number of Participants With Greater Than or Equal to 2 Points Decrease in IGA From Baseline, The IGA utilizes a 6-point scale ranging from 0 (clear) to 5 (very severe disease) where 0 = clear, 1 = almost clear, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate, 4 = severe and 5 (very severe disease)., Week 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24|Number of Participants in IGA, The IGA utilizes a 6-point scale ranging from 0 (clear) to 5 (very severe disease) where 0 = clear, 1 = almost clear, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate, 4 = severe and 5 (very severe disease)., Baseline, Week 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24|Percent Change From Baseline in EASI Total Score, The EASI score was used to measure the severity and extent of AD and measures erythema (E), infiltration (I), excoriation (Ex) and lichenification (L) on a scale of 0 (none) to 3 (severe) on 4 anatomic regions of the body: head, trunk, upper limbs, and lower limbs. Degree of involvement on each of the 4 anatomic regions is scored on a scale of 0 (no eruption) to 6 (greater than \[\>\] 90%-100% eruption).
