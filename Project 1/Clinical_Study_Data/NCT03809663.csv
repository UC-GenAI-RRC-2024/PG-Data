NCT03809663,A Dose Ranging Placebo-Controlled Double-Blind Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Tezepelumab in Atopic Dermatitis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03809663,,TERMINATED,This phase 2b study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of tezepelumab as a monotherapy and explore its efficacy as adjunct therapy in subjects with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD).,YES,Atopic Dermatitis,DRUG: Tezepelumab|OTHER: Placebo,"Number of Participants With Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) Score of 0 (Clear) or 1 (Almost Clear) (IGA 0/1) at Week 16, The IGA allows investigators to assess overall disease severity at 1 given time point and consists of a 6-point severity scale from clear to severe disease

* 0 = clear
* 1 = almost clear
* 2 = mild disease
* 3 = moderate disease
* 4 = severe disease
* 5 = very severe disease

The IGA uses clinical characteristics of erythema, infiltration, papulation, oozing, and crusting as guidelines for the overall severity assessment (Breuer et al, 2004).

Participants who took rescue medication between Day 29 to Week 16 were considered non-responders., Week 16|Number of Participants Who Experienced a 75% Reduction From Baseline in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI 75) at Week 16, The EASI evaluates 4 natural anatomical regions for severity and extent of key disease signs and focuses on key acute and chronic signs of inflammation (ie, erythema, induration/papulation, excoriation, and lichenification).

A reduction in the EASI score indicates an improvement in severity. Participants who took rescue medication between Day 29 to Week 16 were considered non-responders., Baseline and Week 16","Number of Participants Who Experienced a 50% or 90% Reduction From Baseline in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI 50/90) at Week 16, The EASI evaluates 4 natural anatomical regions for severity and extent of key disease signs and focuses on key acute and chronic signs of inflammation (ie, erythema, induration/papulation, excoriation, and lichenification).

A reduction in the EASI score indicates an improvement in severity. Participants who took rescue medication between Day 29 to Week 16 were considered non-responders., Baseline and Week 16|Time to Achievement of 50%, 75% or 90% Reduction From Day 1 in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI 50/75/90), Day 1 up to End of Study Visit (Week 70)|Change From Baseline in Scoring of Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) at Week 16, The SCORAD is a clinical tool for assessing the severity (ie, extent, intensity) of atopic dermatitis (AD). The tool evaluates the extent and intensity of the AD lesions, along with subjective symptoms (Kunz et al, 1997). The total score ranges from 0 to 103, with higher values indicating more severe disease. A negative change from baseline indicates an improvement in severity of disease., Baseline and Week 16|Change From Baseline in Pruritus Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) at Week 16, Pruritus was assessed using an NRS (0-10) with 0 = no itch and 10 = worst imaginable itch. A negative change from baseline indicates an improvement in symptoms., Baseline and Week 16|Serum Trough Concentrations of Tezepelumab After Q2W or Q4W Administration, Switchers were included up to Week 16 and were then excluded from the analysis after switching. All Tezepelumab participants received 420 mg of Tezepelumab on Day 1., Pre-dose on Day 1, Week 2, 4, 12, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 50, 52, 58 and 70|Serum Trough Concentrations of Tezepelumab After Switching to 420 mg Q2W Administration After Week 16, Pre-dose on Week 24, 32, 40, 48, 50, 52, 58 and 70",,Amgen,AstraZeneca,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE2,251,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: QUADRUPLE (PARTICIPANT, CARE_PROVIDER, INVESTIGATOR, OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",20170755|2018-001997-52,2019-03-15,2020-05-12,2020-12-22,2019-01-18,2022-01-25,2022-03-10,"First OC Dermatology, Fountain Valley, California, 92708, United States|Clinical Science Institute, Santa Monica, California, 90404, United States|Hamilton Research, LLC, Alpharetta, Georgia, 30022, United States|Southern Illinois University School of Medicine, Springfield, Illinois, 62702, United States|Dundee Dermatology, West Dundee, Illinois, 60118, United States|DS Research, Clarksville, Indiana, 47129, United States|Epiphany Dermatology of Kansas, LLC, Overland Park, Kansas, 66215, United States|Skin Sciences Pllc, Louisville, Kentucky, 40217, United States|Scott Health Services LLC, Louisville, Kentucky, 40241, United States|Clarkston Skin Research, Clarkston, Michigan, 48346, United States|J Woodson Dermatology and Associates, Henderson, Nevada, 89052, United States|Mount Sinai Hospital, New York, New York, 10029, United States|DermResearch Center of New York Inc, Stony Brook, New York, 11790, United States|Tennessee Clinical Research Center, Nashville, Tennessee, 37215, United States|Modern Research Associates, Dallas, Texas, 75231, United States|Premier Clinical Research, Spokane, Washington, 99202, United States|Holdsworth House Medical Practice, Sydney, New South Wales, 2010, Australia|Veracity Clinical Research, Woolloongabba, Queensland, 4102, Australia|Skin Health Institute, Carlton, Victoria, 3053, Australia|The Royal Melbourne Hospital, Parkville, Victoria, 3050, Australia|Fremantle Dermatology, Fremantle, Western Australia, 6160, Australia|Doctor Chih-Ho Hong Medical Incorporated, Surrey, British Columbia, V3R 6A7, Canada|DermEffects, London, Ontario, N6H 5L5, Canada|Lynderm Research Inc, Markham, Ontario, L3P 1X3, Canada|Cheema Research Incorporated, Mississauga, Ontario, L5A 3V4, Canada|SKDS Research Incorporated, Newmarket, Ontario, L3Y 5G8, Canada|Gordon Sussman Clinical Research Incorporated, North York, Ontario, M3B 3S6, Canada|JRB Research Incorporated, Ottawa, Ontario, K1H 7X3, Canada|Fakultni nemocnice u sv Anny v Brne, Brno, 656 91, Czechia|Nemocnice Novy Jicin as, Novy Jicin, 741 01, Czechia|Fakultni nemocnice Ostrava, Ostrava-Poruba, 708 52, Czechia|Sanatorium profesora Arenbergera, Praha 1, 110 00, Czechia|Nemocnice Na Bulovce, Praha 8, 180 81, Czechia|North Estonia Medical Centre, Tallinn, 13419, Estonia|Clinical Research Centre, Tartu, 50106, Estonia|Tartu University Hospital, Tartu, 50417, Estonia|CharitÃ© Berlin, Berlin, 10117, Germany|UniversitÃ¤tsmedizin GÃ¶ttingen -
