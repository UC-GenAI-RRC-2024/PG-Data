Each body region will be assessed for disease extent ranging from 0% to 100% involvement. The overall total percentage will be reported based off of all 4 body regions combined, after applying specific multipliers to the different body regions to account for the percent of the total BSA represented by each of the 4 regions. Use the percentage of skin affected for each region (0 to 100%) in EASI as follows: BSA Total = 0.1\*BSAhead and neck + 0.3\*BSAtrunk + 0.2\* BSAupper limbs + 0.4\*BSAlower limbs.
