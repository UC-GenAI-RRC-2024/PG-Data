The format is a simple response (0 to 3 where 0 is ""not at all"" and 3 is ""very much"") to 10 questions, which assess QOL over the past week, with an overall scoring system of 0 to 30. The DLQI is calculated by summing the score of each question resulting in a maximum of 30 and a minimum of 0. A higher score indicates more severe disease and poor QoL., Baseline, Weeks 8, 12, 16 and 32|Change From Baseline in Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) (Anxiety) Score at Weeks 8, 12, 16, and 32, In this outcome measure, change from baseline in HADS-Anxiety score at weeks 8, 12, 16 and 32 were reported. The HADS is an instrument for screening anxiety and depression in non-psychiatric populations; repeated administration also provides information about changes to a participant's emotional state. The HADS is a 14-item self-administered questionnaire, 7 each for anxiety and depression symptoms. Each item is scored from 0-3, resulting in total anxiety score ranging from 0 (less severity of anxiety) to 21 (greater severity of anxiety). Higher score indicated more anxiety symptoms. The following cut-off scores are recommended: 7 to 8 for possible presence, 10 to 11 for probable presence, and 14 to 15 for severe anxiety., Baseline, Weeks 8,12,16 and 32|Change From Baseline in HADS (Depression) Score at Weeks 8, 12, 16, and 32, In this outcome measure, change from baseline in HADS-depression score at weeks 8, 12, 16 and 32 were reported.

The HADS is a 14-item self-administered questionnaire, and consists of 7 items each for anxiety and depression symptoms. Each item is scored from 0-3, resulting in total depression score ranging from 0 (less severity of depression) to 21 (greater severity of depression). Higher score indicated more depression symptoms. The following cut-off scores are recommended: 7 to 8 for possible presence, 10 to 11 for probable presence, and 14 to 15 for severe depression., Baseline, Weeks 8,12,16 and 32|Change From Baseline in Patient Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM) Scores at Weeks 8, 12, 16, and 32, The POEM is a 7-item, validated questionnaire used to assess disease symptoms in both children and adults. Participants respond to 7 questions, including dryness, itching, flaking, cracking, sleep loss, bleeding, and weeping, each scored on a 5-point scale based on frequency of occurrence during the previous week: 0 = no days, 1 = 1 to 2 days, 2 = 3 to 4 days, 3 = 5 to 6 days, and 4 = all days. Item scores are added to provide a total score ranging from 0 (clear) to 28 (very severe atopic eczema). Higher scores indicated more severe disease and poor quality of life., Baseline, Weeks 8, 12, 16, and 32|Change From Baseline in SCORing Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) Total Score at Weeks 8, 12, 16, and 32., SCORAD is a validated scoring index for AD, which consists of 3 components that is A =extent or affected body surface area assessed as percentage of each defined body area and reported as the sum of all areas, with a maximum score of 100%. B=severity of 6 specific symptoms of AD (redness, swelling, oozing/crusting, excoriation, skin thickening/lichenification, dryness) assessed using the following scale: none (0), mild (1), moderate (2), or severe (3) (for a maximum of 18 total points) and C=subjective symptoms scored by participants on visual analogue scale, where ""0"" is no itch (or no sleeplessness) and ""10"" is worst imaginable itch (or sleeplessness) with a maximum score of 20. SCORAD total score was calculated using these 3 aspects: extent (A: 0-100), severity (B: 0-18), and subjective symptoms (C: 0-20) using the formula: A/5 + 7\*B/2+ C to give the SCORAD total score range of 0 to 103, where 0 = no disease to 103 = severe disease. Higher values of SCORAD represent worse outcome., Baseline to Weeks 8, 12, 16 and 32|Change From Baseline in Global Individual Signs Score (GISS) at Weeks 8, 12, 16, and 32., GISS assesses AD lesions for erythema, excoriations, lichenification and edema/papulation. Each component was rated on a global basis (over the entire body surface rather than region) using a 4-point scale (0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate and 3=severe) according to the EASI grading severity. The cumulative score, which ranges from 0 to 12, is the sum of the four components. A higher score indicates more severe disease., Baseline, Weeks 8,12,16 and 32",,"Janssen Research & Development, LLC",,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE2,87,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: SEQUENTIAL|Masking: QUADRUPLE (PARTICIPANT, CARE_PROVIDER, INVESTIGATOR, OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",CR108833|77474462ADM2002,2019-10-16,2020-06-30,2020-11-19,2019-07-16,2023-06-28,2023-09-05,"Beach Clinical Research Inc, Huntington Beach, California, 92647, United States|Florida Academic Dermatology Centers, Coral Gables, Florida, 33134, United States|Doral Medical Research, Doral, Florida, 33166, United States|Floridian Research Institute, Miami, Florida, 33145, United States|Florida International Medical Research, Miami, Florida, 33155, United States|Premier Research Associate, Inc, Miami, Florida, 33165, United States|CNS HealthCare, Orlando, Florida, 32801, United States|Avita Clinical Research, Tampa, Florida, 33613, United States|Forcare Clinical Research, Inc., Tampa, Florida, 33613, United States|Advanced Medical Research, Sandy Springs, Georgia, 30328, United States|Dawes Fretzin Clinical Research Group, Indianapolis, Indiana, 46256, United States|Randall Dermatology & Cosmetic Surgery, West Lafayette, Indiana, 47906, United States|Revival Research Institute, LLC, Troy, Michigan, 48084, United States|ClinOhio Research Services, Columbus, Ohio, 43213, United States|Clinical Research Solutions, LLC, Milan, Tennessee, 38358, United States|Progressive Clinical Research, San Antonio, Texas, 78213, United States|Dominion Medical Associates, Inc., Richmond, Virginia, 23233, United States","Study Protocol, https://storage.googleapis.com/ctgov2-large-docs/62/NCT04021862/Prot_000.pdf|Statistical Analysis Plan, https://storage.googleapis.com/ctgov2-large-docs/62/NCT04021862/SAP_001.pdf"
