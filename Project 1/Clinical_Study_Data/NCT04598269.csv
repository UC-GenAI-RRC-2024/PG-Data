NCT04598269,Study of ATI-1777 in Adult Patients With Moderate or Severe Atopic Dermatitis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04598269,,COMPLETED,"This is a first-in-human, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, vehicle-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, tolerability, and PK of ATI-1777 solution following twice-daily applications to target areas of participants with moderate or severe atopic dermatitis (AD).",YES,Atopic Dermatitis,DRUG: ATI-1777|DRUG: Vehicle,"Percent Change From Baseline in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) Score at Week 4, The EASI evaluation was performed by the Principal Investigator and evaluated atopic dermatitis in each of 3 body regions (trunk \[excluding groin and genitalia\], upper extremities \[excluding palms of hands\], and lower extremities \[excluding soles of feet\]). The EASI scoring system uses a defined process to grade the severity of the signs of atopic dermatitis and the extent affected. EASI Scores ranged from 0-72, with higher scores indicative of more severe disease., Baseline, Week 4","Percent Change From Baseline in EASI Score at Days 8 and 15, The EASI evaluation is performed by the Principal Investigator and will evaluate atopic dermatitis in each of 3 body regions (trunk \[excluding groin and genitalia\], upper extremities \[excluding palms of hands\], and lower extremities \[excluding soles of feet\]). The EASI scoring system uses a defined process to grade the severity of the signs of atopic dermatitis and the extent affected. EASI Scores range from 0-72, with higher scores indicative of more severe disease., Baseline, Days 8 and 15|Number of Participants Who Achieve 50% Improvement in EASI Score (EASI 50) by Week 4, The EASI evaluation is performed by the Principal Investigator and will evaluate atopic dermatitis in each of 3 body regions (trunk \[excluding groin and genitalia\], upper extremities \[excluding palms of hands\], and lower extremities \[excluding soles of feet\]). The EASI scoring system uses a defined process to grade the severity of the signs of atopic dermatitis and the extent affected. EASI Scores range from 0-72, with higher scores indicative of more severe disease., Week 4|Number of Participants Who Achieve 75% Improvement in EASI Score (EASI-75) by Week 4, The EASI evaluation is performed by the Principal Investigator and will evaluate atopic dermatitis in each of 3 body regions (trunk \[excluding groin and genitalia\], upper extremities \[excluding palms of hands\], and lower extremities \[excluding soles of feet\]). The EASI scoring system uses a defined process to grade the severity of the signs of atopic dermatitis and the extent affected. EASI Scores range from 0-72, with higher scores indicative of more severe disease., Week 4|Number of Participants Who Achieve 90% Improvement in EASI Score (EASI-90) by Week 4, The EASI evaluation is performed by the Principal Investigator and will evaluate atopic dermatitis in each of 3 body regions (trunk \[excluding groin and genitalia\], upper extremities \[excluding palms of hands\], and lower extremities \[excluding soles of feet\]). The EASI scoring system uses a defined process to grade the severity of the signs of atopic dermatitis and the extent affected. EASI Scores range from 0-72, with higher scores indicative of more severe disease., Week 4|Change From Baseline in Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) Score for Atopic Dermatitis at Days 8 and 15, and Week 4, The IGA is a validated investigator's assessment of the average overall severity of participants' atopic dermatitis at a particular point in time. Scores ranged from 0-4, with higher scores indicative of more severe disease., Baseline, Days 8 and 15, and Week 4|Change From Baseline in Percent of Body Surface Area (BSA) of Atopic Dermatitis at Days 8 and 15 and Week 4, The total percentage of the participants BSA affected by atopic dermatitis was estimated by the investigator or designee using the handprint method, which estimates that the area of a participants' full handprint (fingers and thumbs together) constitutes 1% of their total BSA. Scores ranged from 0-100%, with higher scores indicative of increased percentage of atopic dermatitis on the skin., Baseline, Days 8 and 15, and Week 4|Change From Baseline in Peak Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale (PP-NRS) Score at Days 8 and 15, and Week 4, The PP-NRS is a single patient-reported item designed to measure peak pruritus, or 'worst' itch, over the previous 24 hours. Scores ranged from 0-10, with higher scores indicative of more severe itching., Baseline, Days 8 and 15, and Week 4",,"Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc.",,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE2,50,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: QUADRUPLE (PARTICIPANT, CARE_PROVIDER, INVESTIGATOR, OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",ATI-1777-AD-201,2020-09-30,2021-04-08,2021-04-22,2020-10-22,2023-08-28,2023-09-28,"Aclaris Investigational Site, Scottsdale, Arizona, 85260, United States|Aclaris Investigational Site, Encino, California, 91436, United States|Aclaris Investigational Site, Los Angeles, California, 90045, United States|Aclaris Investigational Site, Tampa, Florida, 33613, United States|Aclaris Investigational Site, Indianapolis, Indiana, 46250, United States|Aclaris Investigational Site, Overland Park, Kansas, 66215, United States|Aclaris Investigational Site, Omaha, Nebraska, 68144, United States|Aclaris Investigational Site, Kew Gardens, New York, 11415, United States|Aclaris Investigational Site, Newtown Square, Pennsylvania, 19073, United States|Aclaris Investigational Site, Fountain Inn, South Carolina, 29644, United States|Aclaris Investigational Site, Austin, Texas, 78759, United States|Aclaris Investigational Site, San Antonio, Texas, 78213, United States|Aclaris Investigational Site, Lynchburg, Virginia, 24501, United States|Aclaris Investigational Site, Newport News, Virginia, 23606, United States","Study Protocol, https://storage.googleapis.com/ctgov2-large-docs/69/NCT04598269/Prot_000.pdf|Statistical Analysis Plan, https://storage.googleapis.com/ctgov2-large-docs/69/NCT04598269/SAP_001.pdf"
