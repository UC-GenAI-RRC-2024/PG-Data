NCT03847389,Clobetasol Topical Oil for Children With Moderate to Severe Atopic Dermatitis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03847389,,TERMINATED,"Open-Label Study designed to evaluate the HPA axis suppression potential of Clobetasol Topical Oil and pharmacokinetic safety / systemic exposure to clobetasol when Clobetasol Topical Oil is applied to pediatric subjects with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis (AD) under maximal use conditions.

The study duration for each subject will be up to 54 days (up to 38 days for Screening assessments, followed by up to 16 days of treatment and follow-up). Additional time will be required for subjects requiring additional hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal \[HPA\] axis function testing due to an abnormal result at End of Treatment.",YES,Atopic Dermatitis,DRUG: Clobetasol propionate 0.05% Topical Oil,"Number of Participants With HPA Axis Suppression - Serum Cortisol Concentration (Cortrosyn Stimulation Test), 30-minute Post-stimulation cortisol level ≤18 µg/100 mL at Day 0 means subject is not enrolled; 30-minute Post-stimulation cortisol level ≤18 µg/100 mL at end of treatment (Day 15) means subject had suppression., day 0 and day 15.|Adverse Events, Including Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), number of events and percentage of subjects with AEs including TEAEs, Days 0, 1, 8 and 15",,"ISGA Category, ISGA results will be summarized at each visit as:

1. number and percentage of subjects in each ISGA category
2. number and percentage of subjects with an ISGA score of either 0 or 1 (clear or almost clear)
3. number and percentage of subjects with an ISGA improvement of at least 2 grades from Baseline to each post-baseline evaluation
4. number and percentage of subjects with an ISGA score of either 0 or 1 (clear or almost clear) and an improvement of at least 2 grades from Baseline to each post-Baseline evaluation, Days 0, 1, 8 and 15 Efficacy assessment, including ISGA, was not performed due to premature termination of the study.|Assessment of Burning/Stinging, Skin Atrophy, Striae, Folliculitis, and Telangiectasias (Tolerability Parameters)., The subject will rate the sensation of burning/stinging within the past 24 hours as none (0), mild (1), moderate (2) or severe (3), and the Investigator will assess skin atrophy, striae, folliculitis, and telangiectasias, as absent (0) or present (1)., Days 1, 8 and 15","Hill Dermaceuticals, Inc.","Synteract, Inc.|Covance",ALL,"CHILD, ADULT",PHASE1|PHASE2,8,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: NA|Intervention Model: SINGLE_GROUP|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,CP0418 SS-P2 051,2019-09-09,2020-05-02,2020-07-28,2019-02-20,2021-05-05,2021-06-23,"International Clinical Research - US, LLC, Sanford, Florida, 32771, United States|AeroAllergy Research Laboratories of Savannah, Inc, Savannah, Georgia, 31406, United States|Paddington Testing Co., Inc., Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, 19103, United States|Spartanburg Medical Research, Spartanburg, South Carolina, 29303, United States|Progressive Clinical Research, San Antonio, Texas, 78213, United States|Clinical Research Partners, LLC, Richmond, Virginia, 23220, United States","Study Protocol, https://storage.googleapis.com/ctgov2-large-docs/89/NCT03847389/Prot_002.pdf|Statistical Analysis Plan, https://storage.googleapis.com/ctgov2-large-docs/89/NCT03847389/SAP_001.pdf"
