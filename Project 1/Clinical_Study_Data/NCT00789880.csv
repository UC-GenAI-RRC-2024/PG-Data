NCT00789880,Analysis of Response of Subjects With Atopic Dermatitis or Psoriasis to Oral Vitamin D3,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00789880,,COMPLETED,This study will examine whether administration of oral Vitamin D3 given over 21 days will change the antimicrobial peptide expression in the skin or saliva of subjects with Atopic Dermatitis (AD). This study will help researchers determine if the lack of the expression of antimicrobial peptides in individuals with AD plays a role in the susceptibility to eczema vaccinatum (EV).,YES,Atopic Dermatitis|Psoriasis,DRUG: Vitamin D3|DRUG: Placebo,"Change From Baseline on Day 21 in Relative Abundance of CAMP mRNA in Lesional and Non-Lesional Skin for Atopic Dermatitis (AD) Participants Who Received Oral Vitamin D3 Versus Vitamin D3-Placebo, Cathelicidin (CAMP) Messenger Ribonucleic Acid (mRNA) expression from skin biopsies measured by quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Average delta cycle threshold (CT) adjusted for non-atopic average at baseline on the arithmetic scale = \[(average of (CT for CAMP - CT for Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH)) across replicates) - (the average of (CT for CAMP - CT for GAPDH) for non-atopic subjects at baseline)\]. A negative value indicates a drop from baseline and a positive value indicates an increase from baseline. Cathelicidin amount is clinically significant as it is necessary to resist infection. Cathelicidin amount is not known to be clinically relevant to the clinical signs of dermatitis associated with AD., Baseline to Day 21|Change From Baseline on Day 21 in Relative Abundance of CAMP mRNA in Non-Lesional Skin for Non-Atopic Dermatitis (Non-AD) Participants Who Received Oral Vitamin D3 Versus Vitamin D3-Placebo, Cathelicidin (CAMP) Messenger Ribonucleic Acid (mRNA) expression from skin biopsies measured by quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR).

Non-AD is defined as a healthy volunteer without atopic dermatitis, therefore the lesional skin-type was not measured in this group. A negative value indicates a drop from baseline and a positive value indicates an increase from baseline. Cathelicidin amount is clinically significant as it is necessary to resist infection. Cathelicidin amount is not known to be clinically relevant to the clinical signs of dermatitis associated with AD., Baseline to Day 21|Change From Baseline on Day 21 in Relative Abundance of CAMP mRNA in Lesional and Non-Lesional Skin for Psoriatic Participants Who Received Vitamin D3 Versus Vitamin D3-Placebo, Cathelicidin (CAMP) messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression from skin biopsies measured by quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Average delta cycle threshold (CT) adjusted for non-atopic average at baseline on the arithmetic scale = \[(average of (CT for CAMP - CT for Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH)) across replicates) - (the average of (CT for CAMP - CT for GAPDH) for non-atopic subjects at baseline)\]. A negative value indicates a drop from baseline and a positive value indicates an increase from baseline, Cathelicidin abundance in psoriasis has been hypothesized to correlate with increased inflammation. No direct clinical correlation is known., Baseline to Day 21|Change From Baseline on Day 21 in Relative Abundance of HBD-3 mRNA in Lesional and Non-Lesional Skin for Atopic Dermatitis (AD) Participants Who Received Oral Vitamin D3 Versus Vitamin D3-Placebo, Human Beta-defensin 3 (HBD-3) Messenger Ribonucleic Acid (mRNA) expression from skin biopsies as measured by quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Average delta cycle threshold (CT) adjusted for non-atopic average at baseline on the arithmetic scale = \[(average of (CT for CAMP - CT for Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH)) across replicates) - (the average of (CT for CAMP - CT for GAPDH) for non-atopic subjects at baseline)\]. A negative value indicates a drop from baseline and a positive value indicates an increase from baseline. HBD-3 amount is clinically significant as it is necessary to resist infection.
