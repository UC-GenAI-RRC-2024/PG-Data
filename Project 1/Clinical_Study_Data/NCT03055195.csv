NCT03055195,Efficacy and Safety Study of Mepolizumab in Subjects With Moderate to Severe Atopic Dermatitis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03055195,,TERMINATED,"Mepolizumab is a humanized Immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody (mAb) that acts on Interleukin-5 (IL-5), which is responsible for the growth and differentiation, recruitment, activation, and survival of eosinophils; thereby reducing the production and survival of eosinophils which may be therapeutic in subjects with atopic dermatitis (AD). This study will investigate the efficacy and safety of mepolizumab (100 milligram \[mg\] subcutaneous \[SC\] administered every 4 weeks) compared with placebo in adult subjects with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis (AD). Subjects will be randomized 1:1 to either placebo SC or mepolizumab SC. The study will comprise of a pre-screening period of up to approximately 4 weeks, a screening period of up to 2 weeks, followed by a 16-Week study treatment period (16 weeks with the last dose of study treatment at Week 12) and follow-up period of up to 4-week. The total duration of subject participation will be approximately 26 weeks. (Note: For subjects, who may need to stop treatment with a biologic, the total Pre-Screening and Screening period may last up to 20 weeks and total duration of participation in the study may be up to 40 weeks).",YES,"Dermatitis, Atopic",DRUG: Mepolizumab 100 mg|DRUG: Placebo matching mepolizumab,"Number of Participants With an Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) Score of 0 or 1 and at Least a 2- Grade Improvement at Week 16, The IGA is a clinical tool for assessing the current state/severity of a participant's atopic dermatitis . It is a static 5-point morphological assessment of overall disease severity determined by the investigator, sub-investigator, or trained healthcare professional with required qualifications on a scale of 0 to 4 where, 0-clear, 1-almost clear, 2-mild, 3-moderate, and 4- severe. Higher score indicates severity of disease. A responder is defined as a participant who had an IGA score of 0 or 1 and a minimum 2-grade improvement from Baseline. Number of participants with IGA score of 0 or 1 and at least a 2- grade improvement at Week 16 was presented., Week 16","Mean Percentage Change in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) Score From Baseline to Each Study Visit, EASI scoring system is a standardized clinical tool for the assessment of atopic dermatitis that takes into account overall extent of the percent body surface area (% BSA) involved and severity scores for each clinical signs (erythema, induration/papulation, excoriation, and lichenification). Severity scores were graded on a 4-point scale, 0(absent) to 3(severe) for each body regions (head and neck, upper extremities, lower extremities, and trunk). The severity scores for each signs were summed for each region and multiplied by the % BSA area score and by the appropriate proportionality multiplier (for participants \>=8 years of age, 0.1 for head, 0.2 upper extremities, 0.3 for trunk and 0.4 for lower extremities) to generate a regional EASI score. The regional EASI scores were then summed to yield the final EASI score. Baseline is defined as latest pre-dose assessment. Percent change from Baseline is Post-Baseline Visit Value minus Baseline, divided by Baseline and multiplied by 100., Baseline (Day 1) and Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16 and 20|Number of Participants With an IGA Score of 0 or 1 and at Least a 2-grade Improvement at Each Study Visit, The IGA is a clinical tool for assessing the current state/severity of a participant's atopic dermatitis .
