NCT01016106,Genetic Screening for Filaggrin Mutation in Atopic Dermatitis and Ichthyosis Vulgaris in the African American Population,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01016106,,COMPLETED,"The investigators' primary objective is to identify common and rare mutations in the filaggrin gene in African American patients with a diagnosis of atopic dermatitis and ichthyosis vulgaris. Atopic dermatitis, or eczema, is a common, chronic, relapsing and remitting problem in many children and affects 10-20% of the pediatric population. Itch is a predominant feature of this disease and is quite disruptive to daily activities of life. In addition to itch, it is characterized by markedly dry skin, small red bumps that may have fluid. Ichthyosis vulgaris is characterized by extremely dry, scaly skin with a fine white scale and increased amounts of lines noted on the palms. Filaggrin is a protein that is essential for the skin to function properly as a barrier and found to be mutated in some European patients with ichthyosis vulgaris and atopic dermatitis. This association has not been looked at in the African American population. Genomic DNA (gDNA) will be purified from buccal swabs using commercially available kits and analyzed.",YES,Atopic Dermatitis|Ichthyosis Vulgaris,GENETIC: Buccal Swab,"Heterozygous for Filaggrin (FLG) Null Mutations, Buccal swab samples were obtained from each subject. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was purified from buccal swabs (IsoHelix Swabs, BocaScientific, Boca Raton, FL) and quantified by ultraviolet spectrophotometry. Purified genomic DNA and controls were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from three different regions of FLG exon 3 with three primer sets. PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis, purified (Qiaquick, Qiagen, Valencia, CA), and subjected to duplicate cycle sequencing reactions using ABI BigDye v3.1 reagents (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA). Labeled sequencing products were purified for capillary electrophoresis (ABI3730 or ABI3130 sequencer with POP7 polymer), and sequence results were examined using ABI SeqScape software. All nucleotide changes were noted, including 30 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) in the population tested, the most common of which were coding changes at T454A, H2507Q, and G2545R, and silent change at nucleotide t2508c., 1 month",,,Northwestern University,ViraCor Laboratories,ALL,"CHILD, ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,35,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: NON_RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: SINGLE_GROUP|Masking: DOUBLE (PARTICIPANT, OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: DIAGNOSTIC",CMH 2010-14049,2010-06,2010-10,2011-09,2009-11-18,2013-04-30,2015-05-01,"Ann & Robert H Lurie CHildren's Hospital of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, 60611, United States|University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, 60637, United States",
