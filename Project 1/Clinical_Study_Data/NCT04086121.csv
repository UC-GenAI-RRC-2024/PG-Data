NCT04086121,A Study to Test the Long-term Safety of BI 655130 in Patients With Atopic Eczema Who Took Part in Study 1368-0032,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04086121,,TERMINATED,To assess the long term safety and efficacy of treatment with BI 655130 in patients with AD who have completed and have responded to treatment in the parent study 1368-0032,YES,"Dermatitis, Atopic",DRUG: Spesolimab,"Number of Patients With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (AEs) at Week 48, Number of patients with treatment emergent adverse events (AEs) at week 48. The treatment emergent adverse event refer to the adverse event with an onset between start of treatment and end of the 16-week residual effect period after the last dose of trial medication., From first dose until Week 48, up to 48 weeks.","Percentage Change From Baseline in the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) Score at Week 48, The EASI scoring system is used routinely in patients with psoriasis to describe signs and severity of the disease. It assesses the extent of disease at four body sites and measures four clinical signs: erythema, induration/papulation, excoriation, and lichenification (each on a scale of 0 to 3 (0 = none, absent; 1 = mild; 2 = moderate; 3 = severe)). The EASI score was obtained by weight-averaging these 4 scores, resulting in the EASI score ranges from 0 (clear) to 72 (very severe), with higher score indicating more severe disease extent and clinical signs. The percent change from baseline in EASI is calculated as: (EASI at week 48 - EASI at baseline) / EASI at baseline \* 100%., At baseline and at Week 48.|Percentage of Patients With a 50% Improvement From Baseline in EASI (EASI50) at Week 48, The EASI scoring system is used routinely in patients with psoriasis to describe signs and severity of the disease. It assesses the extent of disease at four body sites and measures four clinical signs: erythema, induration/papulation, excoriation, and lichenification (each on a scale of 0 to 3 (0 = none, absent; 1 = mild; 2 = moderate; 3 = severe)). The EASI score was obtained by weight-averaging these 4 scores, resulting in the EASI score ranges from 0 (clear) to 72 (very severe), with higher score indicating more severe disease extent and clinical signs. \[(EASI at week 48 - EASI at baseline) / EASI at baseline \* 100%\] ≥ 50%, then EASI50 = 1., At baseline and at Week 48.|Percentage of Patients With a 75% Improvement From Baseline in EASI (EASI75) at Week 48, The EASI scoring system is used routinely in patients with psoriasis to describe signs and severity of the disease. It assesses the extent of disease at four body sites and measures four clinical signs: erythema, induration/papulation, excoriation, and lichenification (each on a scale of 0 to 3 (0 = none, absent; 1 = mild; 2 = moderate; 3 = severe)). The EASI score was obtained by weight-averaging these 4 scores, resulting in the EASI score ranges from 0 (clear) to 72 (very severe), with higher score indicating more severe disease extent and clinical signs. \[(EASI at week 48 - EASI at baseline) / EASI at baseline \* 100%\] ≥ 75%, then EASI75 = 1., At baseline and at Week 48.|Change From Baseline in SCORing of Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) at Week 48, The SCORing of Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) index assesses elements: extent of disease, disease severity and subjective symptoms. The SCORAD consists of three elements: extent of disease, intensity of disease, and subjective symptoms (Pruritus and Sleep Loss). These 3 aspects: extent of disease (A: score range 0-1-2), disease severity (B: score range 0-18), and subjective symptoms (C: score range 0-20) combine using A/5 + 7\*B/2+ C to give a maximum possible score of 103 for SCORAD score. The SCORAD range from 0 (no disease) to 103 (severe disease). The higher the SCORAD score, the more severe the Atopic Dermatitis is., At baseline and at Week 48.|Percentage of Patients Achieving at Least a 2-grade Reduction From Baseline to Clear (0) or Almost Clear (1) in Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) at Week 48, The IGA scale allows investigators to assess overall disease severity at one given time point, and it consists of a five-point severity scale from clear to very severe disease (0= clear,1 =almost clear, 2 = mild disease, 3 = moderate disease, 4= severe disease). The IGA scale uses clinical characteristics of erythema, infiltration, papulation, oozing and crusting as guidelines for the overall severity assessment., At baseline and at Week 48.",,Boehringer Ingelheim,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE2,14,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: NA|Intervention Model: SINGLE_GROUP|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,1368-0037,2019-09-24,2021-04-28,2022-02-23,2019-09-11,2022-04-27,2022-07-19,"CCT Research, Scottsdale, Arizona, 85260, United States|Clinical Physiology Associates, Fort Myers, Florida, 33912, United States|Finlay Medical Research Corp, Miami, Florida, 33126, United States|ForCare Clinical Research, Inc., Tampa, Florida, 33613, United States|The Indiana Clinical Trials Center, PC, Plainfield, Indiana, 46168, United States|Unity Clinical Research, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, 73118, United States|Dermatology Treatment and Research Center, PA, Dallas, Texas, 75230, United States|Innovaderm Research Inc., Montreal, Quebec, H2X 2V1, Canada|Tennocho Ekimae Dermatology and Allergology, Kanagawa, Yokohama, 240-0004, Japan|Tokyo Medical University Hachioji Medical Center, Tokyo, Hachioji, 193-0998, Japan","Study Protocol, https://storage.googleapis.com/ctgov2-large-docs/21/NCT04086121/Prot_000.pdf|Statistical Analysis Plan, https://storage.googleapis.com/ctgov2-large-docs/21/NCT04086121/SAP_001.pdf"
