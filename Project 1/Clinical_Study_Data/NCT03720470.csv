NCT03720470,Study Evaluating Efficacy and Safety of PF-04965842 and Dupilumab in Adult Subjects With Moderate to Severe Atopic Dermatitis on Background Topical Therapy,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03720470,JADE Compare,COMPLETED,"B7451029 is a Phase 3 study to investigate PF-04965842 in adult patients who have moderate to severe atopic dermatitis and use background topical therapy. The efficacy of two dosage strengths of PF-04965842, 100 mg and 200 mg taken orally once daily will be evaluated relative to placebo over 12 weeks. The efficacy of the two dosage strengths of PF-04965842 will be compared with dupilumab in terms of pruritus relief at 2 weeks. The two dosage strengths of PF-04965842 and dupilumab 300 mg injected subcutaneously once every two weeks (with a loading dose of 600 mg injected on the first day) will also be evaluated relative to placebo over 16 weeks. The safety of the investigational products will be evaluated over the duration of the study. Subjects will use non-medicated emollient at least twice a day and medicated topical therapy such as corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors or PDE4 inhibitors, as per protocol guidance, to treat active lesions during the study. Subjects who are randomized to receive one of the two dosage strengths of PF-04965842 will also receive placebo injectable study drug every two weeks until Week 16 and then will continue on receiving only the oral study drug for 4 weeks. Subjects who are randomized to receive dupilumab injections every two weeks will also receive oral placebo to be taken once daily until Week 16 and will then continue to receive only the oral placebo for 4 weeks. Subjects who are randomized to the placebo arms, will receive both daily oral placebo and injectable placebo every two weeks until Week 16, after which they will receive either 100 mg or 200 mg of PF-04965842 taken orally once daily for 4 weeks, dependent upon which arm they have been allocated to.
