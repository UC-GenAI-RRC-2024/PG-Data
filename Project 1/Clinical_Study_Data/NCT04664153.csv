Average erythema, induration, and scaling were scored separately over the whole body according to a 5-point severity scale (0 \[no symptom\] to 4 \[severe symptom\]). The total score was calculated as average of the 3 severity scores and rounded to the nearest whole number score to determine the PGA score and category (0=clear; 1=almost clear; 2=mild; 3=moderate; and 4=severe). PGA response was defined as 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear). In this OM, percentages of participants with a PGA score of 0 or 1 and an improvement of \>=2 from Baseline in PGA score are reported., Baseline, Week 6|Percentage of Psoriasis Participants Achieving PASI 75 (75% or Greater Improvement From Baseline) at Weeks 1, 2, 4, 6 and FUP/EOS, The PASI quantified the severity of a participant's psoriasis based on both, ""lesion severity"" and the ""percent of BSA"" affected. PASI was a composite scoring by the investigator of degree of erythema, induration, and scaling (each scored separately) for each of 4 body regions (head and neck, upper limbs, trunk \[including axillae and groin\], and lower limbs \[including buttocks\]), with adjustment for the percent of BSA involved for each body region and for the proportion of the body region to the whole body. The PASI score could vary in increments of 0.1 and range from 0.0 to 72.0, with higher scores representing greater severity of psoriasis. PASI 75 response was defined as at least a 75 percent (%) reduction in PASI relative to Baseline., Baseline, Weeks 1, 2, 4, 6 and FUP/EOS (28-35 days post-last dose)|Percentage of Psoriasis Participants Who Achieved a Psoriasis Symptoms Inventory (PSI) Score of 0 (Not at All) or 1 (Mild) on Every Item at Weeks 1, 2, 4, 6 and FUP/EOS, PSI was a self-administered 8 item questionnaire that measured the severity of psoriasis symptoms over the past 24 hours and the past 7 days. The measure included concepts of itch, pain, burning, stinging, cracking, scaling, flaking, and redness. Participants were asked to respond to each item using a 5 point Likert response scale: 0: not all severe, 1: mild, 2: moderate, 3: severe and 4: very severe. In this OM, percentages of participants with a PSI score of 0 or 1 on every item at weeks 1, 2, 4, 6 and FUP/EOS are reported., Weeks 1, 2, 4, 6 and FUP/EOS (28-35 days post-last dose)|Change From Baseline in PASI Scores at Weeks 1, 2, 4 and FUP/EOS, Combined assessment of lesion severity and area affected into single score.

PGA response was defined as 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear). In this OM, percentages of participants with a PGA score of 0 or 1 are reported., Weeks 1, 2, 4, 6 and FUP/EOS (28-35 days post-last dose)|Percent Change From Baseline in Affected Body Surface Area (BSA) at Weeks 1, 2, 4, 6 and FUP/EOS, Four body regions were evaluated: head and neck, upper limbs, trunk (including axillae and groin) and lower limbs (including buttocks). Scalp, palms and soles were excluded. BSA was calculated using handprint method. Number of handprints (size of participant's hand with fingers in a closed position) fitting in the affected area of a body region was estimated. Maximum number of handprints were 10 for head and neck, 20 for upper limbs, 30 for trunk and 40 for lower limbs. Surface area of body region equivalent to 1 handprint: 1 handprint was equal to 10% for head and neck, 5% for upper limbs, 3.33% for trunk and 2.5% for lower limbs. Percent BSA for a body region was calculated as = total number of handprints in a body region \* % surface area equivalent to 1 handprint. Overall % BSA for an individual: arithmetic mean of % BSA of all 4 body regions, ranges from 0 to 100%, with higher values representing greater severity of AD., Baseline, Weeks 1, 2, 4, 6 and FUP/EOS (28-35 days post-last dose)|Number of Participants With All-Causality Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), An adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation where participants administered a product or medical device; the event needed not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment or usage. TEAEs were events between first dose of study drug and up to discharge from study that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state. An SAE was any untoward medical occurrence at any dose that: resulted in death, was life threatening, required inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or resulted in congenital anomaly/birth defect., Day 1 through Week 6|Number of Participants With Vital Signs Data Meeting Pre-defined Criteria, Abnormality in vital signs: increase and decrease of change of supine diastolic blood pressure from baseline \>=20 mmHg, supine systolic blood pressure \<90 mmHg, and increase in change of supine systolic blood pressure from baseline \>=30 mmHg., Day 1 through Week 6|Number of Participants With Electrocardiogram (ECG) Data Meeting Pre-defined Criteria, ECG abnormalities criteria included: value of PR interval \>=300 msec, percent change of PR interval \>=25/50% and change of corrected QT interval using Fridericia's Formula (QTcF) \>=30 msec and \<60 msec., Day 1 through Week 6|Number of Participants With Laboratory Test Abnormalities, Laboratory parameters included: hematology (hemoglobin, hematocrit, red blood cell, platelet and white blood cell count, neutrophils, eosinophils, monocytes, basophils and lymphocytes), chemistry (blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, sodium, potassium, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, albumin, total protein and serum pregnancy test \[for all female participants\]) and urine (urine pregnancy test \[for all female participants\])., Day 1 through Week 6|Number of Participants With Different Severity Grades in Skin Tolerability at Day 1, Weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, Early Termination (ET) and FUP, The investigator or designee assessed tolerability at the site of investigational product application (pre-dose and immediately post-dose). This assessment focused on the treated non-lesional skin using the scale: none = no evidence of local intolerance; mild = minimal erythema and/or oedema, slight glazed appearance; moderate = definite erythema and/or oedema with peeling and/or cracking but needs no adaptation of posology; severe (to be reported as an AE) = erythema, oedema glazing with fissures, few vesicles or papules: consider removing topical agent (if still in place); very severe (to be reported as an AE) = strong reaction spreading beyond the treated area, bullous reaction, erosions: removal of topical agent (if still in place)., Day 1, Weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, ET and FUP (28-35 days post-last dose)",,Pfizer,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE2,104,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: QUADRUPLE (PARTICIPANT, CARE_PROVIDER, INVESTIGATOR, OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",C3941002|2020-003977-23,2020-12-21,2021-08-18,2021-08-18,2020-12-11,2022-08-01,2022-08-26,"First OC Dermatology, Fountain Valley, California, 92708, United States|Renaissance Research and Medical Group, Cape Coral, Florida, 33991, United States|Olympian Clinical Research, Clearwater, Florida, 33756, United States|Moonshine Research Center, Inc., Doral, Florida, 33166, United States|Clinical Neuroscience Solutions, Orlando, Florida, 32801, United States|Center for Clinical Studies, Tampa, Florida, 33613, United States|Dawes Fretzin Clinical Research Group, LLC, Indianapolis, Indiana, 46250, United States|The Indiana Clinical Trials Center, PC, Plainfield, Indiana, 46168, United States|Henry Ford Medical Center, New Center One, Detroit, Michigan, 48202, United States|M3 Wake Research, Inc., Raleigh, North Carolina, 27612, United States|Oregon Dermatology and Research Center, Portland, Oregon, 97210, United States|Clinical Neuroscience Solutions, Inc. dba CNS Healthcare, Memphis, Tennessee, 38119, United States|studies in Dermatology, LLC, Cypress, Texas, 77433, United States|Center for Clinical Studies, Houston, Texas, 77004, United States|Center for Clinical Studies, LTD.
