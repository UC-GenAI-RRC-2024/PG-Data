NCT03386032,8-Week Atopic Dermatitis (AD) Treatment Study,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03386032,,COMPLETED,This is a study to investigate the clinical effectiveness of the Sponsor's experimental cream treatment on eczema as measured by visual grading of SCORAD (scoring of atopic dermatitis).,YES,Atopic Dermatitis Eczema,DRUG: Investigational OTC Cream|DRUG: 0.05% Desonide|OTHER: Placebo Cream,"Severity Scoring of Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) Amongst Subjects With Moderate Atopic Dermatitis, SCORAD (Severity Scoring of Atopic Dermatitis) Change from Baseline to Week 8 of atopic dermatitis lesion as measured by the Scoring of Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD). SCORAD is a composite severity index comprising a) the amount/extent of body area affected; b)b) 2 subjective symptom of pruritus (10 pts VAS) and sleep disturbance measured (10 pts VAS); and c) 6 disease intensity assessments \[Dryness/Scaling, Erythema, Excoriation, Induration/Papulation, Lichenification and Oozing/ Weeping/Crusting, each graded in 3pts TIS from 0 (None) to 3 (Severe). A SCORAD score ranges from 0 (No AD present) to 103

SCORAD is calculated:
