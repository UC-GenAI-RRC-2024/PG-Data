NCT01941537,"Randomized Placebo Controlled Study to Determine Safety, Pharmacodynamics and Efficacy of ILV-094 in Atopic Dermatitis",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01941537,,COMPLETED,"Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common inflammatory skin disorder that adversely affects most aspects of everyday life in majority of patients. It has a prevalence of up to 3-4% of adults and up to 25% among children. AD has a complex pathogenesis, characterized by: 1) immune activation with increased numbers of T-cells, dendritic cells (DCs), and increased expression of inflammatory molecules 2) marked epidermal hyperplasia in chronic diseased skin, and 3) defective barrier function with increased trans-epidermal water loss (TEWL) and decreased lipids, reflecting underlying alterations in keratinocyte differentiation. AD is predominantly a Th2 (IL-4, IL-13, and IL-31) disease, and recently was also found to be a ""T22"" (IL-22) polarized disease.

ILV-094 is an anti IL-22 antibody and therefore should reverse the immune activation of AD. This study is being done to assess the safety, tolerability, clinical efficacy, and mechanism of action of ILV-094 in patients with AD.",YES,Atopic Dermatitis,DRUG: ILV-094|DRUG: Placebo Comparator,"Percentage Change in SCORAD, Percentage Change in the Scoring of Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) at week 12 compared to baseline in both arms of the study in subjects with atopic dermatitis.

SCORAD (Severity scoring of Atopic Dermatitis) is composite severity index comprising a) the amount/extent of body surface area affected, b) subjective symptom visual analog assessments \[itchy 0 (no itching) to 3 (severe itching) and sleep disturbance 0(no sleep disturbance) to 3 (severe sleep disturbance)\], and c) 6 disease intensity assessments \[dryness/scaling, erythema, induration/papulation, excoriation, lichenification and oozing/weeping/crusting, each graded from 0 to (none) to 3 (severe). A SCORAD score ranges from 0 (no AD present) to 103 (severe)., 12 weeks","The Percentage of Patients Who Achieve an Improvement of 50% or Greater From Their Baseline Objective SCORAD at Week 12 of ILV-094 Treatment, The SCORAD50 captures individuals who achieved 50% or greater improvement from baseline SCORAD score. This outcome measure is the percentage of participants who achieved SCORAD50 at week 12. This analysis will be performed using fisher exact test. Patients who drop-out will be considered treatment failures (non-responder approach). A sensitivity analysis will be carried out using data as observed., 12 weeks|The (Per-patient) Percent Improvement in the SCORAD Relative to Baseline., The (per-patient) percent improvement in the SCORAD relative to baseline, which will be analyzed using the MMRM approach described for the primary efficacy endpoint. Improvement is measured as the reduction in the score., 12 weeks|Change in IGA Score, Change in Investigator Global Assessment score (IGA) at week 12 as compared to baseline for both arms of the study in subjects with atopic dermatitis.

IGA is a score between 0-5, with 0 being all clear, 1 being almost clear, 2 being mild disease, 3 being moderate disease, 4 being severe disease and 5 being very severe disease., 12 weeks",,Rockefeller University,Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE2,60,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: TRIPLE (PARTICIPANT, CARE_PROVIDER, INVESTIGATOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",JKR-0766,2013-10,2016-02,2019-01,2013-09-13,2019-01-10,2019-05-07,"The Rockefeller University, New York, New York, 10065, United States",
