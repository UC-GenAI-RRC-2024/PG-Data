NCT03961529,Long-term Trial of OPA-15406 Ointment in Adult and Pediatric Patients With Atopic Dermatitis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03961529,,COMPLETED,To demonstrate the safety of 1% OPA-15406 ointment in adult patients with AD and of 0.3% and 1% OPA-15406 ointments in pediatric patients with AD administered twice daily for 52 weeks.,YES,Atopic Dermatitis,DRUG: 0.3% OPA-15406 ointment|DRUG: 1% OPA-15406 ointment,"Number of Subjects Experiencing Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), The number of subjects were calculated regarding adverse events occurring after IMP administration (=TEAEs)., Treatment period (52 weeks)","Responder Rate of Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA), The investigator or subinvestigator assessed the skin symptoms using IGA. The investigator or subinvestigator scored the severity (0 = clear, 1 = almost clear, 2 =mild, 3 = moderate, 4 = severe/very severe) of the overall symptoms of the treatment area (erythema, infiltration, papules, effusion and scab formation) from baseline to Week 52.

Incidence of success in IGA is defined as the rate of subjects whose IGA score is 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear) and has improved by at least 2 grades (responders) from baseline., Week 52|Responder Rate of Eczema Area and Severity Index 75 (EASI 75), The investigator or sub investigator assessed the symptoms of AD using EASI. EASI's minimum and maximum scores are 0 and 72 scores respectively. The higher the EASI score is, the more severe the symptoms of AD. The investigator or sub investigator scored the severity (0-3 points) and affected body surface area (%) based on the 4 symptoms (erythema, infiltration/papules, excoriation, and lichenification) on the 4 body regions (face, neck and head ; upper limbs ;trunk; and lower limbs).

EASI 75 is defined as the rate of subjects whose EASI score has improved at least 75% from baseline., Week 52",,"Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.",,ALL,"CHILD, ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,366,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: NON_RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,271-102-00006,2019-05-14,2020-11-11,2020-11-11,2019-05-23,2021-10-21,2021-11-19,"Shirao clinic of pediatrics and pediatric allergy, Hiroshima, Japan","Study Protocol, https://storage.googleapis.com/ctgov2-large-docs/29/NCT03961529/Prot_000.pdf|Statistical Analysis Plan, https://storage.googleapis.com/ctgov2-large-docs/29/NCT03961529/SAP_001.pdf"
