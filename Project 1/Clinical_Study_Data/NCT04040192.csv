When a flare occurred first, the duration of flare free maintenance was the time from randomization to the first flare and was not censored. Duration of flare free maintenance was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method., From randomization to first flare or last ISGA assessment (up to 52 weeks)|Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), An adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention. An AE was considered a TEAE if the event started on or after the treatment period start date and before end of study (at least 28 days after last dose of study intervention)., Crisaborole 2% BID: From start of study intervention in OL period up to 8 weeks ; Vehicle QD and crisaborole 2% QD: From start of study intervention in DB period up to 28 days after last dose of study intervention (maximum of 56 weeks)","Number of Flare-Free Days During the DB Period, Flare - free days was the sum of the duration of flare-free maintenance during the DB maintenance period for each participant., Up to maximum of 52 weeks|Number of Flares During the DB Period, Flare was defined as an ISGA score of \>=2. The ISGA is a 5-point scale (range 0 to 4), reflecting a global assessment of AD severity based on erythema, induration/papulation, and oozing/crusting. ISGA score of 2: mild (faint pink erythema with mild induration/papulation and no oozing/crusting) 3: moderate (pink-red erythema with moderate induration/papulation with or without oozing/crusting) and 4: severe (deep or bright red erythema with severe induration/papulation and with oozing/crusting)., Up to maximum of 52 weeks|Secondary: Duration of Pruritus Response Maintenance Until Onset of First Flare During the DB Period: Participants Aged >=12 Years With Baseline Peak Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale (PP NRS) >=3, >=4 and >=3, >=4 Points Reduction in PP NRS, Duration of pruritus response maintenance=time from randomization to loss of pruritus response or first flare onset(ISGA\>=2) during 52-week DB period evaluated among pruritus responders at randomization.

Evaluated among pruritus responders at randomization. Responders were defined as participants with success in ISGA and EASI50 criteria. Pruritus response maintenance=maintenance of \>=50% improvement in pruritus from baseline that was obtained at randomization. If an event (e.g., death, first flare \[ISGA \>=2\], lost to follow up, or end of study) occurred before loss of pruritus response for first flare-free period, duration of maintenance of pruritus response was time from randomization to last assessment and was censored.

Each item was rated on a 4-point scale, with scores ranging from 0 to 3, where higher scores indicated more anxiety/depression symptoms. HADS-A assessed state of generalized anxiety. HADS-A total score = sum of all 7 items with score ranging from 0 (no presence of anxiety) to 21 (severe feeling of anxiety); higher score indicated greater severity of anxiety. HADS-D assessed the state of lost interest and diminished pleasure response.
