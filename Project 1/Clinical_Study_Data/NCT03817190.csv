A decrease in Validated Global Investigator Assessment scale indicates a positive outcome for the participant., 20 Weeks|Change From Baseline in EASI in Treated Population Compared to Placebo Population to Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 18 and 20., Change from Baseline in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) in treated population compared to placebo population to Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 18 and 20. EASI quantifies the severity of a patient's atopic dermatitis (AD) based on both lesion severity and the percent of body surface area (BSA) affected.

The EASI is a composite score ranging from 0 (no lesion severity) to 72 (severe lesions) that takes into account the degree of erythema, induration/papulation, excoriation, and lichenification (each scored from 0 to 3 separately, half points are permitted) for each of four body regions, with adjustment for the percent of Body Surface Area (BSA) involved for each body region and for the proportion of the body region to the whole body. The severity of each sign is assessed using a 4-point scale (half points are permitted):

* 0 = none
* 1 = mild
* 2 = moderate
* 3 = severe A decrease in EASI indicates a positive outcome for the participant., Week 20|Change From Baseline in Worst Itch NRS in Treated Population Compared to Placebo Population to Week 4, 8, 12, 16, 18., Change from Baseline in worst itch Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) in treated population compared to placebo population to Week 4, 8, 12, 16 and 18. Severity of pruritus related to atopic dermatitis (AD) was self-assessed by patients daily using the NRS. Patients were asked to estimate the intensity of pruritus at its worst over the previous 24 hours. The Pruritus NRS is a single-question assessment tool that was used to assess the patient's worst itch as a result of AD in the previous 24 hours. Patients will score their pruritus due to AD on a scale of 0 - 10, with 0 indicating no itch and 10 indicating the worst itch imaginable. Patients will complete the rating scale daily starting at screening through to the last study visit. A decrease in worst itch NRS indicates a positive outcome for the participant., Week 18|Proportion of Patients Achieving a Decrease of at Least 3 Points in Worst Itch NRS in Treated Population Compared to Placebo Population From Baseline to Week 4, 8, 12, 16, 18 and 20., Proportion of Patients Achieving a Decrease of at Least 3 Points in Worst Itch Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) in Treated Population Compared to Placebo Population From Baseline to Week 4, 8, 12, 16, 18 and 20.

Six items (erythema, edema/papulation, oozing/crusts, excoriation, lichenification, and dryness) will be selected to evaluate the AD severity. The intensity of each item is graded using a 4-point scale:

* 0 = No symptoms
* 1 = Mild
* 2 = Moderate
* 3 = Severe The overall body surface area (BSA) affected by AD is evaluated (from 0 to 100%) and included in the SCORAD scores. Loss of sleep and pruritus will be evaluated by patients on a visual analog scale (0-10)., 18 Weeks|Incidence of Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)., Incidence of Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) in Safety Analysis Set., 20 Weeks",,DS Biopharma,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE2,219,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: DOUBLE (PARTICIPANT, INVESTIGATOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",DS107G-05-AD3,2019-09-19,2020-09-03,2020-09-03,2019-01-25,2022-02-02,2022-11-28,"DS Investigational Site 524, Birmingham, Alabama, 35209, United States|DS Investigational Site 528, Huntington Beach, California, 92647, United States|DS Investigational Site 502, Los Angeles, California, 90045, United States|DS Investigational Site 504, San Diego, California, 92108, United States|DS Investigational Site 505, San Diego, California, 92123, United States|DS Investigational Site 516, Santa Ana, California, 92705, United States|DS Investigational Site 501, Santa Monica, California, 90404, United States|DS Investigational Site 517, Washington, District of Columbia, 20037, United States|DS Investigational Site 527, Doral, Florida, 33122, United States|DS Investigational Site 510, Sunrise, Florida, 33351, United States|DS Investigational Site 512, Columbus, Georgia, 31904, United States|DS Investigational Site 514, Skokie, Illinois, 60077, United States|DS Investigational Site 513, Louisville, Kentucky, 40241, United States|DS Investigational Site 519, Troy, Michigan, 48084, United States|DS Investigational Site 511, Raleigh, North Carolina, 27612, United States|DS Investigational Site 526, Grants Pass, Oregon, 97527, United States|DS Investigational Site 521, Medford, Oregon, 97504, United States|DS Investigational Site 525, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, 19046, United States|DS Investigational Site 509, Arlington, Texas, 76011, United States|DS Investigational Site 506, Austin, Texas, 78745, United States|DS Investigational Site 508, Cypress, Texas, 77433, United States|DS Investigational Site 507, San Antonio, Texas, 78213, United States|DS Investigative Site 529, Orem, Utah, 84058, United States|DS Investigative Site 530, Salt Lake City, Utah, 84117, United States|DS Investigational Site 523, Richmond, Virginia, 23224, United States|DS Investigational Site 518, Kenosha, Wisconsin, 53144, United States|DS Investigational Site 101, Graz, Austria|DS Investigational Site 203, Augsburg, Germany|DS Investigational Site 202, Berlin, Germany|DS Investigational Site 208, Berlin, Germany|DS Investigational Site 204, Dresden, Germany|DS Investigational Site 206, Essen, Germany|DS Investigational Site 201, Frankfurt, Germany|DS Investigational Site 207, Gera, Germany|DS Investigational Site 211, Leipzig, Germany|DS Investigational Site 205, Luebeck, Germany|DS Investigational Site 210, Mainz, Germany|DS Investigational Site 214, Münster, Germany|DS Investigational Site 212, Rostock, Germany|DS Investigational Site 304, Jūrmala, Latvia|DS Investigational Site 301, Riga, Latvia|DS Investigational Site 302, Riga, Latvia|DS Investigational Site 303, Riga, Latvia|DS Investigational Site 305, Riga, Latvia|DS Investigational Site 406, Gdańsk, Poland|DS Investigational Site 403, Poznań, Poland|DS Investigational Site 405, Warsaw, Poland|DS Investigational Site 407, Warsaw, Poland|DS Investigational Site 401, Wrocław, Poland|DS Investigational Site 402, Łódź, Poland","Study Protocol, https://storage.googleapis.com/ctgov2-large-docs/90/NCT03817190/Prot_000.pdf|Statistical Analysis Plan, https://storage.googleapis.com/ctgov2-large-docs/90/NCT03817190/SAP_001.pdf"
