The scoring of each question is: Very much =3; Quite a lot = 2; Only a little = 1; Not at all = 0. CDLQI total score is calculated by summing all 10 items responses, and has a range of 0 to 30 (higher scores are indicative of greater impairment).

LS Mean was calculated using MMRM model which includes treatment, baseline value, visit, the interaction of the baseline value-by-visit as covariates, the interaction of treatment by-visit, geographic region, age group, and baseline IGA (3 versus 4) score as fixed factors., Baseline, Week 16",,Eli Lilly and Company,"Dermira, Inc.",ALL,"CHILD, ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,445,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: QUADRUPLE (PARTICIPANT, CARE_PROVIDER, INVESTIGATOR, OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",17802|2019-002933-12|J2T-DM-KGAC|DRM06-AD05,2019-10-29,2021-07-12,2022-04-28,2019-11-26,2022-07-11,2023-05-24,"Investigate MD, Scottsdale, Arizona, 85255, United States|Northwest Arkansas Clinical Trials Center, Rogers, Arkansas, 72758, United States|Bakersfield Dermatology and Skin Cancer Medical Group, Bakersfield, California, 93309, United States|Center For Dermatology Clinical Research, Inc., Fremont, California, 94538, United States|Woodward Centre, Fresno, California, 93720, United States|Dermatology Research Associates, Los Angeles, California, 90045, United States|LA Universal Research Center, INC, Los Angeles, California, 90057, United States|University Clinical Trials, Inc., San Diego, California, 92123, United States|San Luis Dermatology & Laser Clinic, San Luis Obispo, California, 93405, United States|Clinical Physiology Associates, Clinical Study Center, Fort Myers, Florida, 33916-9452, United States|Direct Helpers Medical Center, Hialeah, Florida, 33012, United States|The Community Research of South Florida, Hialeah, Florida, 33016, United States|Solutions Through Advanced Research, Inc., Jacksonville, Florida, 32256, United States|Georgia Pollens Clinical Research Centers, Inc, Albany, Georgia, 31707, United States|Marietta Dermatology Clinical Research, Marietta, Georgia, 30060, United States|Advanced Medical Research, Sandy Springs, Georgia, 30328, United States|Arlington Dermatology, Rolling Meadows, Illinois, 60008, United States|NorthShore University HealthSystem, Skokie, Illinois, 60077, United States|Kansas City Dermatology, PA, Overland Park, Kansas, 66215, United States|Meridian Clinical Research, Baton Rouge, Louisiana, 70808, United States|ActivMed Practices and Research, Beverly, Massachusetts, 01915, United States|Tufts Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts, 02111, United States|Great Lakes Research Group, Inc., Bay City, Michigan, 48706, United States|Clarkston Skin Research, Clarkston, Michigan, 48346, United States|Associated Skin Care Specialists, Fridley, Minnesota, 55432, United States|Central Dermatology PC, Saint Louis, Missouri, 63117, United States|Forest Hills Dermatology Group, Kew Gardens, New York, 11415, United States|OnSite Clinical Solutions, Charlotte, North Carolina, 28277, United States|Wilmington Dermatology Center, Wilmington, North Carolina, 28405, United States|Dermatology and Skin Surgery Center, Exton, Pennsylvania, 19341, United States|DermDOX, Hazleton, Pennsylvania, 18201, United States|Peak Research LLC, Upper Saint Clair, Pennsylvania, 15241, United States|Dermatology & Laser Center of Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina, 29407, United States|Palmetto Clinical Trial Services, Greenville, South Carolina, 29601, United States|Arlington Research Center, Inc, Arlington, Texas, 76011, United States|Innovate Research, LLC, Fort Worth, Texas, 76244, United States|Austin Institute for Clinical Research, Pflugerville, Texas, 78660, United States|University of Utah MidValley Dematology, Murray, Utah, 84107, United States|Virginia Clinical Research, Inc., Norfolk, Virginia, 23502, United States|Dermatology Associates, Seattle, Washington, 98101, United States|DCC Sveti Georgi, Plovdiv, 4000, Bulgaria|Diagnostic and Consultation Center 14, Sofia, 1408, Bulgaria|Alexandrovska University Hospital, Sofia, 1432, Bulgaria|Euro Derma clinic, Sofia, 1606, Bulgaria|Military Medical Academy, Sofia, 1606, Bulgaria|Medical centre Alitera-Med EOOD, Sofia, 1618, Bulgaria|Dr. Chih-ho Hong Medical Inc., Surrey, British Columbia, V3R 6A7, Canada|Simcoderm Medical & Surgical Dermatology Centre, Barrie, Ontario, L4M 7G1, Canada|Lynderm Research Inc., Markham, Ontario, L3P1X2, Canada|North York Research Inc., North York, Ontario, M2M4J5, Canada|Ottawa Allergy Research Corp, Ottawa, Ontario, K1G 6C6, Canada|K.
