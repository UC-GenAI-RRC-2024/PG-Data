NCT04220411,A Study for AR100DP1 in Mild to Moderate Atopic Dermatitis (AD),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04220411,,TERMINATED,"This is a Phase I/IIa Open-Label, Dose-Escalation Study to Determine the Safety, Tolerability, and Efficacy of AR100DP1 in Health Subjects, and Subjects with Mild to Moderate Atopic Dermatitis.",YES,"Dermatitis, Atopic",DRUG: AR100DP1,"Number of Subjects With DLTs, Phase I study included 14 days of treatment with AR100DP1, followed by 2 weeks of follow-up period to find the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of AR100DP1.

DLTs were defined as any adverse event (AE) ≥ Grade 2 (Guidance for Industry: Toxicity Grading Scale for Healthy Adult and Adolescent Volunteers Enrolled in Preventive Vaccine Clinical Trials, issued by United States Food and Drug Administration in September 2007), that was considered to be causally related (possibly, probably, or definitely related) to AR100DP1 as judged by the investigator up to Day 29. The definition of Grade 5 (death related to AE) was added to this grading system as it was not defined in the guidance. (reported in the subsequent Primary Outcome Measure). MTD is defined as the highest dose level at which \< 2 of 6 subjects experienced a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT)., up to Day 29 for each cohort in phase I|Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of AR100DP1, Per protocol, MTD is defined as the highest dose level at which \< 2 of 6 subjects experienced a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT).

MTD was determined by testing increasing doses up to 125 mg/day via topical administration on AR100DP1_1.25%, 2.5%, and 5% groups with 3 to 6 subjects each.

DLTs were defined as any adverse event (AE) ≥ Grade 2 (Guidance for Industry: Toxicity Grading Scale for Healthy Adult and Adolescent Volunteers Enrolled in Preventive Vaccine Clinical Trials, issued by United States Food and Drug Administration in September 2007), that was considered to be causally related (possibly, probably, or definitely related) to AR100DP1 as judged by the investigator up to Day 29. The definition of Grade 5 (death related to AE) was added to this grading system as it was not defined in the guidance. (reported in the previous Primary Outcome Measure)., up to Day 29 for each cohort in phase I|Percentage of Subjects With the Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) Score of 0 or 1 on Day 29 (Phase IIa), The IGA is a 5-point scale that provides a global clinical assessment of AD severity based on an ordinal scale, scored by the investigator. The scores of IGA are 0 (clear), 1 (almost clear), 2 (mild), 3 (moderate) and 4 (Severe)., Day 29 (Phase IIa)","Percentage of Subjects With the Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) Score of 0 ~ 4 (Phase IIa), The IGA is a 5-point scale that provides a global clinical assessment of AD severity based on an ordinal scale, scored by the investigator. The scores of IGA are 0 (clear), 1 (almost clear), 2 (mild), 3 (moderate) and 4 (Severe)., Day 8, Day 15, Day 22, Day 29, Day 36 and Day 43 (Phase IIa)|Change From Baseline in Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) of Itch Level on Target Lesions, The pruritus NRS is comprised itch level grading from the numbers 0 (""no itch"") to 10 (""worst imaginable itch""). Subjects are asked to rate the intensity of their itch by visits., Day 8, Day 15, Day 22, Day 29, Day 36 and Day 43 (Phase IIa)|Change of IgE Compared to Baseline (Day 1), Day 15 and 29 (Phase IIa)|Fold Change of IL-4 Compared to Baseline (Day 1 ), Day 15 and 29 (Phase IIa)|Change From Baseline in Signs of Atopic Dermatitis (Erythema, Edema, Excoriation and Lichenification) on Target Lesions, 4 symptoms of atopic dermatitis (erythema, edema, excoriation and lichenification) will be evaluated on all target lesions and graded from 0 to 3 (none, mild, moderate and severe, respectively), with half points allowed, Day 8, Day 15, Day 22, Day 29, Day 36 and Day 43 (Phase IIa)|Change From Baseline in the Total Score of Patient-Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM), POEM is a validated, patient-derived assessment measure for monitoring atopic eczema severity , available at the HOME (Harmonising Outcome Measures for Eczema) group. It contains seven symptoms of AD on 5-point (0 to 4) scale with total score 0 to 28 during the study.

A higher score means a worse outcome, whereas a lower score is a better outcome., Day 8, Day 15, Day 22, Day 29, Day 36 and Day 43 (Phase IIa)|Number of Subjects With AE and SAE, Day -14 to 29 (Phase I); Day -14 to 43 (Phase IIa)|Change From Baseline in Vital Signs (Systolic Blood Pressure), Vital signs measurement will consist of systolic/diastolic blood pressure, respiratory rate, pulse rate or heart rate, and body temperature., Day 1 to 29 (Phase I); Day 1 to 43 (Phase IIa)|Number of Subjects With Physical Examination Abnormalities, Physical examination will include the following items: general appearance, skin, eyes, ears, nose, throat, head and neck, heart, chest and lungs, abdomen, extremities, lymph nodes, musculoskeletal, neurological and others., Day -14 to 29 (Phase I); Day -14 to 43 (Phase IIa)|Number of Subjects With 12-lead ECG Abnormalities, ECG will be evaluated by the investigators and noted as ""Normal"", ""Abnormal, non-clinical significant (NCS)"" or ""Abnormal, clinical significant (CS)"", Day 1, Day 8, Day 15, Day 22, Day 29 (Phase I); Day 1, Day 8, Day 15, Day 22, Day 29, Day 43 (Phase IIa)|Number of Subjects With Clinically Significant Laboratory Abnormalities (Hematology), Laboratory tests include hematology (hemoglobin, hematocrit, RBC, platelet, WBC with different counts), biochemistry (total bilirubin, AST, ALT, serum creatinine and albumin), Day 8 to Day 29 (Phase I); Day 8 to Day 43 (Phase IIa)|Change From Baseline in Vital Signs (Diastolic Blood Pressure), Vital signs measurement will consist of systolic/diastolic blood pressure, respiratory rate, pulse rate or heart rate, and body temperature., Day 1 to 29 (Phase I); Day 1 to 43 (Phase IIa)|Change From Baseline in Vital Signs (Pulse Rate), Vital signs measurement will consist of systolic/diastolic blood pressure, respiratory rate, pulse rate or heart rate, and body temperature., Day 1 to 29 (Phase I); Day 1 to 43 (Phase IIa)|Change From Baseline in Vital Signs (Respiration Rate), Vital signs measurement will consist of systolic/diastolic blood pressure, respiratory rate, pulse rate or heart rate, and body temperature., Day 1 to 29 (Phase I); Day 1 to 43 (Phase IIa)|Change From Baseline in Vital Signs (Body Temperature), Vital signs measurement will consist of systolic/diastolic blood pressure, respiratory rate, pulse rate or heart rate, and body temperature., Day 1 to 29 (Phase I); Day 1 to 43 (Phase IIa)|Number of Subjects With Clinically Significant Laboratory Abnormalities (Biochemistry), Laboratory tests include hematology (hemoglobin, hematocrit, RBC, platelet, WBC with different counts), biochemistry (total bilirubin, AST, ALT, serum creatinine and albumin), Day 8 to Day 29 (Phase I); Day 8 to Day 43 (Phase IIa)|Percentage of Subjects Achieving the Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) Score of 0 (Clear) or 1 (Almost Clear) on Day 8, Day 15, Day 22, Day 36 and Day 43 (Phase IIa), The IGA is a 5-point scale that provides a global clinical assessment of AD severity based on an ordinal scale, scored by the investigator.
