NCT02118766,"Safety and Efficacy of AN2728 Topical Ointment, 2% in Children, Adolescents, and Adults (Ages 2 Years and Older) With Atopic Dermatitis",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02118766,,COMPLETED,"The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety and efficacy of AN2728 Topical Ointment, 2% in children, adolescents, and adults (ages 2 years and older) with atopic dermatitis.",YES,"Dermatitis, Atopic","DRUG: AN2728 Topical Ointment, 2%|DRUG: Matching vehicle control","Percentage of Participants Who Achieved Treatment Success Based on Investigator's Static Global Assessment (ISGA) at Day 29, ISGA assessed the severity of AD (except scalp and venous access area) on a 5-point scale ranged from 0 (clear) to 4 (maximum severe), where higher scores indicate higher degree of AD. Grades for classification of severity: 0= clear (minor residual hypo/hyper pigmentation, no erythema or induration or papulation, no oozing or crusting), 1= almost clear (trace faint pink erythema, with barely perceptible induration or papulation and no oozing or crusting), 2= mild (faint pink erythema with mild induration or papulation and no oozing or crusting), 3= moderate (pink-red erythema with moderate induration or papulation with or without oozing or crusting) and 4= severe (deep or bright red erythema with severe induration or papulation and with oozing or crusting). Treatment success was defined as an ISGA score of Clear (0) or Almost Clear (1) with at least a 2-grade improvement from baseline., Day 29|Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (AEs) And Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), An AE was any untoward medical occurrence attributed to a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. An SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; Initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Treatment-emergent were events between first dose of study drug and up to end of study that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pre-treatment state., AEs: Baseline (Day 1) up to Day 29, SAEs: Baseline (Day 1) up to Day 36|Number of Participants With Clinically Significant Change From Baseline in Vital Signs at Day 29, Following parameters were analyzed for examination of vital signs: systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respiratory rate and body temperature. Vital sign measurements were performed with the participant in the seated or supine position. Clinical significance of change from baseline value was determined by investigator., Baseline, Day 29|Number of Participants With Clinically Significant Change From Baseline in Laboratory Values at Day 29, Laboratory values included: Alkaline Phosphatase, Alanine Aminotransferase, Aspartate Aminotransferase, Albumin, Blood Urea Nitrogen, Creatinine, Hematocrit, Hemoglobin, Lymphocytes, Monocytes, Neutrophils, Platelets, Basophils, Eosinophils, Red blood cell count, White blood cell count, Total bilirubin and Glucose (nonfasting), Potassium, Total Protein, and Sodium. Clinical significance of change from baseline value was determined by investigator., Baseline, Day 29","Percentage of Participants With an Investigator's Static Global Assessment (ISGA) Score of Clear (0) or Almost Clear (1) at Day 29, ISGA assessed the severity of AD (except scalp and venous access area) on a 5-point scale ranged from 0 (clear) to 4 (maximum severe), where higher scores indicate higher degree of AD. Grades for classification of severity: 0= clear (minor residual discoloration, no erythema or induration or papulation, no oozing or crusting), 1= almost clear (trace faint pink erythema, with barely perceptible induration or papulation and no oozing or crusting), 2= mild (faint pink erythema with mild induration or papulation and no oozing or crusting), 3= moderate (pink-red erythema with moderate induration or papulation with or without oozing or crusting) and 4= severe (deep or bright red erythema with severe induration or papulation and with oozing or crusting). Percentage of participants with an ISGA score of 0 or 1 were reported., Day 29|Time to Achieve Treatment Success Based on Investigator's Static Global Assessment (ISGA), Time to achieve treatment success based on ISGA was defined as the time interval between the administrations of first dose of study drug until first documentation of success in ISGA. Success in ISGA was defined as an ISGA score of clear (0) or almost clear (1) with at least 2-grade improvement from baseline. It was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier method., Baseline (Day 1) up to Day 29|Change From Baseline in Signs of Atopic Dermatitis (AD) at Day 29, Signs of AD included erythema, induration/papulation, exudation, excoriation and lichenification. Each sign was assessed on a 4- point scale ranges from 0 to 3, where 0= none, 1= mild, 2= moderate to 3= severe. Higher score indicates severe signs and symptoms of AD., Baseline, Day 29","Time to Improvement in Pruritus, Time to improvement in pruritus was defined as the time interval between the administration of first dose of study drug till the first documentation of improvement in pruritus. Improvement in pruritus was defined as achieving none (0) or mild (1) score with at least a 1- grade improvement from baseline. Severity of pruritus was assessed on 4-point numeric scale ranges from 0 to 3, where 0= none (no itching), 1= mild (occasional, slight itching/scratching), 2= moderate (constant or intermittent itching/scratching which is not disturbing sleep) and 3= severe (bothersome itching/scratching which is disturbing sleep). Higher scores indicated more severe condition. It was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier method., Baseline up to Day 29|Change From Baseline in Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) Score at Day 29, The DLQI was a 10-item questionnaire that measures the impact of skin disease on participant's quality of life. Each question was evaluated on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 3 (very much); where higher scores indicate more impact on quality of life. The DLQI total score ranges from 0 (not at all) to 30 (very much): 0-1 = no effect at all on the participant's life; 2-6 = small effect on the participant's life; 7-12 = moderate effect on the participant's life; 13-18 = very large effect on the participant's life; 19-30 = extremely large effect on the participant's life. Higher scores indicate more impact on quality of life of participants., Baseline, Day 29",Pfizer,,ALL,"CHILD, ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,763,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: QUADRUPLE (PARTICIPANT, CARE_PROVIDER, INVESTIGATOR, OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",AN2728-AD-301,2014-03,2015-04,2015-04,2014-04-21,2017-01-09,2017-03-06,"Anacor Investigational Site, Stockbridge, Georgia, United States",
