For each region the area score is recorded as the percentage of skin affected by eczema. For each region, the severity score is calculated as the sum of the intensity scores (scored as none \[0\], mild \[1\], moderate \[2\], or severe \[3\]) for redness (erythema, inflammation), thickness (induration, papulation, swelling - acute eczema), scratching (excoriation), and lichenification (lined skin, prurigo nodules - chronic eczema).

The total EASI score for each region is calculated by multiplying the severity score by the area score, with adjustment for the proportion of the body region to the whole body.
