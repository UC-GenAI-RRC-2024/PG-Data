NCT02910011,Topical NanoDoxÂ® for Atopic Dermatitis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02910011,,COMPLETED,"This study will investigate the safety and clinical efficacy of a novel doxycycline topical formulation in subjects with Atopic Dermatitis (AD). The investigators hypothesize that daily application of the study drug in AD subjects will reduce severity of the disease, by reducing skin driven inflammation and restoring skin barrier function. The investigators will also monitor the anti-microbial activity of this product on AD skin, as colonization with Staph aureus is typically associated with disease severity.",YES,"Dermatitis, Atopic",DRUG: Nanodox 1% (doxycycline monohydrate hydrogel),"Number of Participants With Treatment-related Adverse Events as Assessed by CTCAE v4.0, comparing dermatological scores of treated lesions vs non treated lesions and treated peri-lesional areas with non-treated non-lesional areas, up to 4 weeks of study drug use","Number of Participants With Reduction in Growth of Skin Flora Including S.Aureus, (positive or negative), difference in number of growth (0 to 3+++), up to 4 weeks of study drug use|Number of Participant With a Change in Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) in Target Area, 1 point reduction of IGA score in Target area pre-treatment compared to post treatment (v3), 4 weeks of topical therapy",,University of Florida,"Alchem Laboratories, Inc",ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE2,23,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: NA|Intervention Model: SINGLE_GROUP|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,IRB201601657 - A,2017-05-18,2018-11-30,2018-11-30,2016-09-21,2020-01-21,2020-03-26,"UF HealthStreet, Gainesville, Florida, 32608, United States|UF Health Springhill, Gainesville, Florida, 32653, United States","Informed Consent Form, https://storage.googleapis.com/ctgov2-large-docs/11/NCT02910011/ICF_000.pdf|Study Protocol and Statistical Analysis Plan, https://storage.googleapis.com/ctgov2-large-docs/11/NCT02910011/Prot_SAP_001.pdf"
