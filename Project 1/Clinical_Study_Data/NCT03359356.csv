NCT03359356,Treatment of Alopecia Areata (AA) With Dupilumab in Patients With and Without Atopic Dermatitis (AD),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03359356,,COMPLETED,"Alopecia areata is a medical condition, in which the hair falls out in patches. The hair can fall out on the scalp or elsewhere on the face and body. Alopecia areata is an autoimmune skin disease, which means that the immune system is recognizing the hair follicles as foreign and attacking them, causing round patches of hair loss. It can progress to total scalp hair loss (alopecia totalis) or complete body hair loss (alopecia universalis). The scalp is the most commonly affected area, but the beard or any hair-bearing site can be affected alone or together with the scalp. Alopecia areata occurs in males and females of all ages, and is a highly unpredictable condition that tends to recur. Alopecia areata can cause significant distress to both patients and their families. In this study, the aim is to assess the effects of dupilumab in patients with alopecia areata.",YES,Alopecia Areata,DRUG: Dupilumab|DRUG: Placebo,"Change From Baseline in the Severity of Alopecia Tool (SALT) Score at Week 24, The SALT is a validated instrument for measuring the amount of scalp hair loss at a single point in time The SALT is a validated instrument for measuring the amount of scalp hair loss at a single point in time SALT - Scalp divided into four areas: vertex (40% of scalp surface area), right profile (18% of scalp surface area), left profile (18% of scalp surface area), and posterior scalp (24% of scalp surface area). Percentage of hair loss in these areas is multiplied by percent surface area of the scalp in that area. SALT score is the sum of percentage of hair loss in all areas. SALT scores range from 0 (no hair loss) to 100 (complete scalp hair loss) with lower score indicating better health outcomes/less hair loss. Primary Outcome is baseline minus Week 24 value., Baseline and 24 weeks","Change From Week 24 in the SALT Score at Week 48, SALT - Scalp divided into four areas: vertex (40% of scalp surface area), right profile (18% of scalp surface area), left profile (18% of scalp surface area), and posterior scalp (24% of scalp surface area).
