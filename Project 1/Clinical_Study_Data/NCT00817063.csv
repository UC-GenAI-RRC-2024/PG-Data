NCT00817063,Efficacy and Safety of a Retinoid in the Treatment of Severe Chronic Hand Eczema,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00817063,HANDEL,COMPLETED,The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety and efficacy of alitretinoin in the treatment of severe chronic hand eczema that does not respond to treatment with potent topical steroids.,YES,Eczema,DRUG: alitretinoin|DRUG: Placebo,"Number of Participants Who Responded as Per Physician's Global Assessment (PGA) at Week 24, The investigator assigned PGA grades according to a 5-point scale (clear \[not detectable\], almost clear \[less than 10% of affected hand surface\], mild disease \[less than 10% of affected hand surface\], moderate disease \[10% to 30% of affected hand surface\], severe disease \[\>30% of affected hand surface\]). PGA ratings were based on an integrated clinical picture of signs, symptoms, and the extent of disease. Symptoms included erythema, scaling, hyperkeratosis/lichenification, vesiculation, edema, fissures, and pruritus/pain. The PGA scale ranges from 0 (no symptom) to 4 (severe disease). Participants were considered as responders when they had a PGA of clear or almost clear., Week 24 (end-of-treatment)","Percentage Change From Baseline in Modified Total Lesion Symptom Score (mTLSS) at the End-of-treatment, A 4-point scale (0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe) was used to grade 7 signs or symptoms of CHE. The mTLSS was calculated as sum of assigned scores for the symptoms of erythema, scaling, lichenification/hyperkeratosis, vesiculation, edema, fissures and Pruritus/Pain. The total score ranged from 0 (best) to 21 (worst). Baseline was defined at Week 0. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the individual post-baseline values. Percentage change from Baseline = (change from Baseline / Baseline value) \* 100. Data for Week 24 last observation carried forward (LOCF) has been presented., Baseline (Week 0) and Week 24 (end-of-treatment)|Number of Participants Who Responded as Per Patient Global Assessment (PaGA) at End-of-treatment, At Week 24 or at the end-of-treatment participants were asked by the investigator to grade their overall change from Baseline by selecting one of the following descriptions, which best matched their perception of overall treatment effect: cleared or almost cleared (at least 90% clearing), marked improvement (at least 75% clearing), moderate improvement (at least 50% clearing), mild improvement (at least 25% clearing), no change and worsening. Participants were considered as responders when the PaGa was cleared or almost cleared., Week 24 (end-of-treatment)|Percentage Change From Baseline in Extent of Disease at End-of-treatment, The extent of disease was estimated as the percentage of hand area (with 100% defined as the palmar and dorsal aspects) affected by eczema at Baseline, and at the end of treatment). Extent of disease was estimated separately for the left and right hands, and the overall extent of disease for both hands was calculated as (Left+Right)/2. Baseline was defined at Week 0. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the individual post-baseline values. Percentage change from Baseline = (change from Baseline / Baseline value) \* 100., Baseline (Week 0) and Week 24 (end-of-treatment)|Response Duration for Responding Participants at the End-of-therapy, Response Duration was defined as time from the end-of-therapy to the first diagnosis of mild, moderate, or severe CHE. Median and inter-quartile range has been presented., Up to 72 Weeks (including 24 weeks of treatment and 48 weeks of follow-up)|Time to Relapse for Responding Participants at the End-of-therapy, Time to relapse was defined as the time from end-of-therapy to the first diagnosis of severe CHE. Median and inter-quartile range has been presented. The median was based on the very last participant having a follow-up period longer than expected, those explaining the high median., Up to 72 Weeks (including 24 weeks of treatment and 48 weeks of follow-up)|Time to Response for Responding Participants at End-of-therapy, Time to response was defined as time from start of treatment to first PGA assessment of ""clear"" or ""almost clear"". Median and inter-quartile range has been presented., Up to 72 Weeks (including 24 weeks of treatment and 48 weeks of follow-up)|Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) During the Treatment Period, An AE was defined as any adverse change from the participant's Baseline (pretreatment) clinical condition, including intercurrent illness, which occurred during the course of the clinical study after written informed consent had been given, whether considered related to treatment or not. A treatment-emergent AE was defined as any adverse change that occurred after treatment started and up to 7 days after last treatment. An SAE was any experience that suggested a significant hazard, contradiction, side effect or precaution. It was any adverse event that at any dose resulted in death, was life-threatening, required in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity or was a congenital anomaly/birth defect., Up to Week 24 (end-of-treatment)|Number of Participants With Maximum Post Baseline Laboratory Values Outside the Marked Reference Range, Blood samples were collected for the assessment of laboratory parameters hemoglobin, hematocrit, erythrocytes, mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, reticulocytes, platelets, white blood cell, lymphocytes, neutrophils, monocytes, eosinophils, basophils, total bilirubin, bilirubin conjugated (direct), aspartate amino transferase (AST), alanine amino transferase (ALT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatine phosphokinase (CPK), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), total protein, serum albumin, glucose, triglycerides, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, sodium, potassium, chloride, serum calcium, serum phosphate, serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN)/urea, uric acid, Free thyroxin and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) at Baseline and every 4 weeks of treatment period and Week 28 of follow up period. Data for participants with values outside the marked reference range are reported., Up to Week 28|Number of Participants Referred or Not Referred to a Psychiatrist as Per Brief Summary Inventory (BSI) 53 Questionnaire up to 24 Weeks, The BSI is a 53 item self-report scale used to measure nine primary symptom dimensions (somatization, obsessive-compulsive behavior, interpersonal sensitivity, depression, anxiety, hostility, phobic anxiety, paranoid ideation, and psychoticism). Respondents rank each feeling item (e.g., ""your feelings being easily hurt"") on a 5-point scale where, 0=not at all, 1=a little bit, 2=moderately, 3=quite a bit, 4=extremely (0 indicates best outcome and 4 indicates worst outcome). The total score ranged from 0 (best outcome) to 212 (worse outcome). Participants with an increase above Baseline of 25% or more on any domain subscore in BSI-53, or with an increase above Baseline of \>=2 points or a score \>=3 on any BSI-53 item that reflects depression, suicidality, psychotic symptoms, and hostility/aggression, were to be referred to a psychiatrist within 2 weeks., Up to Week 24|Change From Baseline in Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) Score Over 28 Weeks, The PHQ-9 was a standardized tests of mood/depression. This was a nine item measure with a response for each item between 0-3 where, 0=not at all, 1= several days, 2= more than half the days, 3= nearly every day. Total scores on this measure range from 0-27, with 0 being a minimum indicating no depressive symptoms, and 27 being the maximum number and severity of depressive symptoms. Baseline was defined at Week 0. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the individual post-baseline values., Baseline (Week 0) and Week 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28|Number of Participants Meeting the Referral Criteria of Psychiatric Evaluation Over 28 Weeks, Participants meeting any of the following criteria were to be referred for specialist psychiatric evaluation within 2 weeks: PHQ-9 Score \>=15, Two Subsequent Scores of \>=10 and PHQ-9 Question 9 \>=1.
