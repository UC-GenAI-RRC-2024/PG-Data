NCT02780167,Study To Evaluate Pf-04965842 In Subjects With Moderate To Severe Atopic Dermatitis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02780167,,COMPLETED,"Study B7451006 is a Phase 2b POC study which is planned to assess four PF 04965842 once daily (QD) doses (10, 30, 100, 200 mg) relative to placebo over 12 weeks to characterize the efficacy and safety of PF 04965842 in subjects with moderate to severe AD. The objectives of the study are to demonstrate the efficacy of PF 04965842 by showing improvement in disease severity in patients with moderate to severe AD as measured by the Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) and Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) scores, and safety to support further clinical development of PF 04965842.",YES,Atopic Dermatitis,DRUG: PF-04965842|DRUG: PF-04965842|DRUG: PF-04965842|DRUG: PF-04965842|DRUG: Placebo,"Percentage of Participants Achieving the Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) for Clear (0) or Almost Clear (1) and >=2 Points Improvement From Baseline at Week 12, The IGA score quantifies the severity of participants' atopic dermatitis (AD).

Handprint refers to that of each individual participant for their own measurement. The BSA Efficacy ranges from 0 to 100%, with higher values representing greater severity of AD. Since the scalp, palms, and soles are excluded from the BSA (Efficacy) assessment, the maximum possible value is less than 100%., Baseline and all scheduled time points, including Weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 13, 14, 16|Change From Baseline in Scoring Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) at All Scheduled Time Points, SCORAD is a validated scoring index for AD, which combines extent (0-100), severity (0-18), and subjective symptoms (0-20) based on pruritus and sleep loss, each scored (0-10). Extent, denoted as A, is measured by BSA affected by AD as a percentage of the whole BSA. The score for each body region is added up to determine A (maximum of 100%). Severity, denoted as B, consists of the severity of several signs. Each is assessed as none(0), mild(1), moderate(2) or severe(3). The severity scores are added together to give B (maximum of 18). Subjective symptoms, denoted as C, are each scored by the subject or caregiver using a numeric rating scale (NRS) where ""0"" is no itch (or no sleeplessness) and ""10"" is the worst imaginable itch (or sleeplessness). These scores are added to give 'C' (maximum of 20). The SCORAD for an individual is calculated by the formula: A/5 + 7B/2 + C (can range from 0 to 103).

Treatment-emergent AEs were events that occurred between the first dose of study drug and the subject's last visit (Week 16) that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state., Baseline till Week 16|Number of Participants With Specific Clinical Laboratory Abnormalities (Anemia, Neutropenia, Thrombocytopenia, Lymphopenia, Lipid Profile, Liver Function Tests (LFTs), Baseline up to Week 16|Percentage of Participants With Patient Global Assessment (PtGA) of AD of Clear (0) or Almost Clear (1) and >=2 Points Improvement From Baseline at All Scheduled Time Points, The PtGA asked the participant to evaluate the overall cutaneous disease at that point in time on a single-item, 5-point scale. The same category labels used in the Physician's Global Assessment was used for the PtGA, ie, ""severe (4)"", ""moderate (3)"", ""mild (2)"",""almost clear (1)"", and ""clear (0)"".

It has been extensively used in clinical trials for AD. The DLQI is a psychometrically valid and reliable instrument that has been translated into several languages, and the DLQI total scores have been shown to be responsive to change. The minimally important difference for the DLQI has been estimated as a 2-5 point change from baseline. Each item is scored as ""very much (3)"", ""a lot (2)"", ""a little (1)"" and ""not at all (0)"". The score can range from 0 to 30. The higher values represent the worse dermatology life quality., Baseline and all scheduled time points, including Weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 14, 16|Change From Baseline in Patient Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM) at All Scheduled Time Points, The POEM is a 7-item patient reported outcome (PRO) measure used to assess the impact of AD over the past week. Each item is scored as ""no days (0)"", ""1-2 days (1)"", ""3-4 days (2)"", ""5-6 days (3)"" and ""every day (4)"". The score ranges from 0 to 28. The higher values represent more severe AD., Baseline and all scheduled time points, including Weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 14, 16|Change From Baseline in the Hospital and Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS) at All Scheduled Time Points, The HADS is a 14-item PRO measure used to detect states of anxiety and depression over the past week. The HADS was completed as per schedule of activities. Seven of the items relate to anxiety and seven relate to depression. Each item is scored from 0 to 3 which means a person can score between 0 to 21 for either anxiety or depression.
