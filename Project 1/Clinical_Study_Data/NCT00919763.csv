NCT00919763,Efficacy and Safety Study of CD2027 Ointment 3 Microgram Per Gram (mcg/g) Twice Daily Treatment for Adults With at Least Moderate Atopic Dermatitis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00919763,,COMPLETED,"This was a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, parallel group study. Efficacy Objectives: To evaluate the efficacy of CD2027 ointment 3 mcg/g applied twice daily over 4 weeks versus its vehicle in adult participants with at least moderate atopic dermatitis.

Safety objective: To evaluate safety of CD2027 ointment 3 mcg/g when applied twice daily over 4 weeks versus its vehicle on 5 percent (%) - 20% involved Body Surface Area (BSA) (excluding Head/Neck) in adult participants with at least moderate atopic dermatitis.",YES,Atopic Dermatitis,"DRUG: CD2027 Ointment 3 mcg/g, twice daily|DRUG: Vehicle Ointment, twice daily","Total Severity Score (TSS) of Target Lesion at Baseline and Week 4, TSS comprised of the sum of an assessment of erythema, excoriation, exudation, lichenification and pruritus, each on a scale of 0 to 3 to give a maximum score of 15; 0 (best) and 3 (worst) indicated total possible minimum score was 0 and total possible maximum score was 15. Lower score meant improvement in condition and higher score indicated worsening of condition., Baseline, Week 4","Change From Baseline in Total Severity Score (TSS) for Individual Signs at Week 4, TSS comprised of the sum of an assessment of erythema, excoriation, exudation, lichenification and pruritus, each on a scale of 0 to 3 to give a maximum score of 15; 0 (best) and 3 (Worst) indicated total possible minimum score was 0 and total possible maximum score was 15. Data for individual signs is reported in this outcome measure. Lower score meant improvement in condition and higher score indicated severity (worsening of condition) for each individual sign.

Erythema was evaluated on a four point scale of 0 to 3 where (0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe). Excoriation evaluated on a four point scale of 0 to 3 where (0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe). Exudation was evaluated on a four point scale of 0 to 3 where (0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe). Lichenification was evaluated on a four point scale of 0 to 3 where (0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe). Pruritus was evaluated on a four point scale of 0 to 3 where (0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe)., Baseline, Week 4|Number of Participants With Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) Score of ""0"" or ""1"" and Failure From Baseline of Greater Than 1 Points Over Week 4, IGA was an assessment scale used to determine severity of Atopic Dermatitis (AD) and clinical response to treatment on a 5-point scale (0=clear; 1=almost clear; 2=mild; 3=moderate; 4=severe) based on erythema and papulation/infiltration. Therapeutic response was an IGA score of 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear). Participants with IGA score of ""0"" or ""1"" and a failure from baseline of greater than (\>1) points over 4 weeks were reported., Baseline, Week 1, Week 2, Week 3, Week 4|Percent Change From Baseline in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) Total Score at Week 1, 2, 3, 4, The EASI score quantifies the severity and extent of AD and measures erythema, infiltration, excoriation and lichenification on a scale of 0 (none) to 3 (severe) on 4 anatomic regions of the body: head, trunk, upper limbs, and lower limbs. Degree of involvement on each of the 4 anatomic regions was scored on a scale of 0 (no eruption) to 6 (\>90%-100% eruption). The total score was the sum of the four body-region scores, maximum=72, minimum=0, Higher scores indicated greater disease severity., Baseline, Week1, Week2, Week 3, Week 4",,Galderma R&D,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE2,102,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: QUADRUPLE (PARTICIPANT, CARE_PROVIDER, INVESTIGATOR, OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",RD.06.SPR.18158,2009-05-21,2009-10-01,2009-10-01,2009-06-12,2012-01-19,2022-07-19,"Burke Pharmaceutical Research, Hot Springs, Arkansas, 71913, United States|Therapeutics Clinical Research, Inc., San Diego, California, 92123, United States|Colorado Medical Research Center, Inc., Denver, Colorado, 80120, United States|Longmont Medical Research Network, Longmont, Colorado, 80501, United States|International Dermatology Research, Inc., Miami, Florida, 33144, United States|Dermatology Specialists PSC, Louisville, Kentucky, 40202, United States|Minnesota Clinical Study Center, Fridley, Minnesota, 55432, United States|Academic Dermatology Associates, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87106, United States|Helendale Dermatology & Medical Spa, LLC, Rochester, New York, 104609, United States|Oregon Dermatology & Research Center, Portland, Oregon, 97210, United States|Oregon Medical Research Center, Portland, Oregon, 97223, United States|Arlington Research Center, Inc., Arlington, Texas, 76011, United States|DermResearch Inc., Austin, Texas, 78759, United States|J&S Studies, Inc., College Station, Texas, 77845, United States",
