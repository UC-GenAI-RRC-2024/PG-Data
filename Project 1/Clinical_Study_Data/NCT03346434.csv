Sleep diary items, either alone or in combination serve as subjective measures of sleep quality, difficulty falling asleep, nighttime awakenings, and sleep duration. Sleep quality is measured using an 11-point NRS (0 to 10) in which 0 indicates worst possible sleep while 10 indicates best possible sleep., Week 16|Part B: Change From Baseline in Participant's Skin Pain NRS at Week 16, Skin pain was assessed by the parent/caregiver and measured using a 11-point scale (0 to 10) in which 0 indicated no pain while 10 indicated worst pain possible.

DFI questions were scored on a four-point Likert scale ranging from 0 to 3, so that the total DFI score ranges from 0 to 30. Timeframe of reference was the past week. A higher DFI score indicated greater impairment in family Quality of life (QOL) as affected by atopic dermatitis. A negative change from baseline indicated improvement., Week 16|Part B: Change From Baseline in Children's Dermatology Life Quality Index (CDLQI) at Week 16, CDLQI is a validated 10 question tool to measure impact of skin disease on QOL in children by assessing how much the skin problem has affected the subjects over past week. Nine questions were scored as follows: Very much = 3, Quite a lot = 2, Only a little = 1, Not at all or unanswered = 0. Question 7 has an added possible response, which was scored as 3. CDLQI equals the sum of the score of each question (max. = 30, min. = 0). Higher the score, the greater the impact on QOL.

IDQOL questionnaires were designed for infants (below the age of 4 years) with atopic dermatitis. The IDQOL was calculated by summing the score of each question resulting in a maximum of 30 and a minimum of 0. The higher the score in each questionnaire, the more quality of life is impaired. A negative change from baseline indicated improvement., Week 16|Part B: Percentage of Topical Corticosteroid (TCS) Medication-free Days From Baseline to Week 16, Percentage of TCS medication-free days was calculated as the number of days that a subject used neither TCS/TCI nor system rescue therapy divided by the study days., Baseline up to Week 16|Part B: Mean Weekly Dose of Low Potency TCS in Grams From Baseline to Week 16, Mean weekly dose of TCS in grams/week for low potency TCS from baseline to Week 16 is reported., Baseline up to Week 16|Part B: Mean Weekly Dose of TCS in Grams for Medium or High Potency TCS From Baseline to Week 16, Mean weekly dose of TCS in grams/week for medium or high potency TCS from baseline to Week 16 is reported., Baseline up to Week 16|Part B: Mean Number of Caregiver Missed Work Days Through Week 16, Mean of number of caregiver missed work days through Week 16 is reported., Baseline through Week 16",,Regeneron Pharmaceuticals,Sanofi,ALL,CHILD,PHASE2|PHASE3,202,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: NON_RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: SINGLE_GROUP|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,R668-AD-1539|2016-000955-28,2017-11-30,2021-07-08,2021-07-08,2017-11-17,2022-06-14,2022-07-28,"Regeneron Investigational Site, Birmingham, Alabama, 35209, United States|Regeneron Investigational Site, Gilbert, Arizona, 85234, United States|Regeneron Investigational Site, Long Beach, California, 90808, United States|Regeneron Investigational site, Los Angeles, California, 90027, United States|Regeneron Investigational Site, Palo Alto, California, 94304, United States|Regeneron Investigational Site, Rolling Hills Estates, California, 90274, United States|Regeneron Investigational Site, San Diego, California, 92123, United States|Regeneron Investigational Site, Washington, District of Columbia, 20010, United States|Regeneron Investigational Site, Coral Gables, Florida, 33146, United States|Regeneron Investigational Site, Tampa, Florida, 33612-3807, United States|Regeneron Investigational Site, Columbus, Georgia, 31904, United States|Regeneron Investigational Site, Macon, Georgia, 31217, United States|Regeneron Investigational Site, Sandy Springs, Georgia, 39328, United States|Regeneron Investigational Site, Chicago, Illinois, 60611, United States|Regeneron Investigational Site, Rockville, Maryland, 20850, United States|Regeneron Investigational Site, Boston, Massachusetts, 02115, United States|Regeneron Investigational Site, Ann Arbor, Michigan, 48109-5314, United States|Regeneron Investigational Site, Ypsilanti, Michigan, 48197, United States|Regeneron Investigational Site, Saint Louis, Missouri, 63104-1003, United States|Regeneron Investigational Site, Lincoln, Nebraska, 68505, United States|Regeneron Investigational Site, Hackensack, New Jersey, 07601, United States|Regeneron Investigational Site, Forest Hills, New York, 113756, United States|Regeneron Investigational Site, New York, New York, 10032, United States|Regeneron Investigational Site, Rochester, New York, 14642, United States|Regeneron Investigational Site, Portland, Oregon, 97239, United States|Regeneron Investigational Site, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, 19104, United States|Regeneron Investigational Site, Charleston, South Carolina, 29425, United States|Regeneron Investigational Site, North Charleston, South Carolina, 29420, United States|Regeneron Investigational Site, Austin, Texas, 78723, United States|Regeneron Investigational Site, San Antonio, Texas, 78218, United States|Regeneron Investigational Site, Norfolk, Virginia, 23502, United States|Regeneron Investigational Site, Seattle, Washington, 98105, United States|Regeneron Investigational Site, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, 53226, United States|Regeneron Investigational Site, Osnabrück, Lower Saxony, 49074, Germany|Regeneron Investigational site, Muenster, North Rhine-Westphal, 48149, Germany|Regeneron Investigational Site, Dresden, Sachsen, 01307, Germany|Regeneron Investigational site, Frankfurt/ Main, 60590, Germany|Regeneron Investigational Site, Kiel, 24105, Germany|Regeneron Investigational Site, Muenchen, 80337, Germany|Regeneron Investigational site, Muenchen, 80802, Germany|Regeneron Investigational Site, Bialystok, 15-453, Poland|Regeneron Investigational Site, Katowice, 40-648, Poland|Regeneron Investigational Site, Krakow, 31-011, Poland|Regeneron Investigational Site, Ostrowiec Swietokrzyski, 27-400, Poland|Regeneron Investigational Site, Warszawa, 01-142, Poland|Regeneron Investigational Site, Warszawa, 01-817, Poland|Regeneron Investigational Site, Manchester, Lancashire, M13 9WL, United Kingdom|Regeneron Investigational Site, Sheffield, South Yorkshire, S10 2TH, United Kingdom","Study Protocol, https://storage.googleapis.com/ctgov2-large-docs/34/NCT03346434/Prot_000.pdf|Statistical Analysis Plan, https://storage.googleapis.com/ctgov2-large-docs/34/NCT03346434/SAP_001.pdf"
