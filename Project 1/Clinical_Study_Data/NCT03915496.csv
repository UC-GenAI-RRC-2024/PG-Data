Participants will be screened within 28 days prior to the first dose of study intervention to confirm eligibility. A total of approximately 51 participants will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive PF-04965842 200 mg once daily (QD), PF004965842 100 mg QD, or matching placebo QD for 12 weeks. At the end of the 12-week study treatment, qualified participants will have the option to enter the long-term extension study B7451015 (NCT03422822).

Participants were asked to assess their worst itching due to AD on an NRS anchored by the terms ""no itch"" (0) and ""worst itch imaginable"" (10). Participants who withdrew from the study were counted as non-responder. Spearman correlation coefficient was calculated to assess the relationship between PP-NRS CFB and fold CFB of IHC and gene expression biomarkers., Baseline, Week 12|Percentage of Participants Achieving Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) Response of 'Clear' or 'Almost Clear' and >=2 Points Improvement From Baseline at Week 2, 4, 8 and 12, The IGA of AD is scored on a 5-point scale (0-4), reflecting a global consideration of the erythema, induration and scaling.

Participants who withdrew from the study were counted as non-responder., Baseline, Week 2, 4, 8, 12|Percentage of Participants Achieving EASI Response ≥ 90% Improvement From Baseline at Week 2, 4, 8 and 12, The EASI quantifies the severity of AD based on both severity of lesion clinical signs and the percent of BSA affected. The EASI score can vary in increments of 0.1 and range from 0.0 to 72.0, with higher scores representing greater severity of AD. Participants who withdrew from the study were counted as non-responder., Baseline to Week 2, 4, 8 and 12|Percentage of Participants Achieving EASI Response ≥ 50% Improvement From Baseline at Week 2, 4, 8 and 12, The EASI quantifies the severity of AD based on both severity of lesion clinical signs and the percent of BSA affected. The EASI score can vary in increments of 0.1 and range from 0.0 to 72.0, with higher scores representing greater severity of AD. Participants who withdrew from the study were counted as non-responder., Baseline to Week 2, 4, 8 and 12|Percent Change From Baseline in Percentage Body Surface Area (BSA) at Week 2, 4, 8 and 12, BSA efficacy is derived from the sum of the BSA in handprints across 4 body regions assessed as part of the EASI assessment. Handprint refers to that of each individual participant for their own measurement. The BSA efficacy ranges from 0 to 100%, with higher values representing greater severity of AD. The percentage BSA ranges from 0 to 100, with higher scores representing greater severity of AD.
