Number of handprints (size of participant's hand with fingers in a closed position) fitting in the affected area of a body region was estimated. Four body regions were evaluated: head and neck, upper limbs, trunk (including axillae and groin/genitals) and lower limbs (including buttocks). Total number of handprints were 10 for head and neck, 20 for upper limbs, 30 for trunk and 40 for lower limbs. Surface area of body region equivalent to 1 handprint: 1 handprint was equal to 10% for head and neck, 5% for upper limbs, 3.33% for trunk and 2.5% for lower limbs. Percent BSA for a body region was calculated as = total number of handprints in a body region \* % surface area equivalent to 1 handprint. Overall % BSA for an individual was derived as sum of % BSA across all 4 body regions and ranged from 0 to 100%, with higher values representing greater severity of AD., Baseline (Day 1), Week 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 26|Percent Change From Baseline in the SCORing Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) Total Score at Week 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 26, SCORAD is a scoring index for AD which combined extent (A), severity (B) and subjective symptoms (C). For A, a rule of 9 was used to calculate BSA affected by AD as % of whole BSA for each body region- head and neck 9%; upper limbs 9% each; lower limbs 18% each; anterior trunk 18%; back 18%; genitals 1%. Score of each body region was added to determine A (range: 0-100). B: severity of each sign (erythema; edema/papulation; oozing/crusting; excoriation; skin thickening; dryness) was assessed as none (0), mild (1), moderate (2), severe (3); severity scores were added to give B (range: 0-18). C: pruritus and sleep loss, each of these 2 were scored by participant/caregiver using visual analog scale (VAS) where, 0=no itch/no sleep loss and 10=worst imaginable itch/sleep loss, higher scores=worse symptoms. Scores for itch and sleep loss were added to give 'C' (range: 0-20).

Each item was rated on a 4-point scale, with scores ranging from 0 to 3, where higher scores indicated more anxiety/depression symptoms. HADS-D assessed the state of lost interest and diminished pleasure response (lowering of hedonic tone). HADS-D: total score was calculated as the sum of all 7 items with score ranging from 0 (no presence of depression) to 21 (severe feeling of depression); higher score indicated greater severity of depression symptoms., Baseline (Day 1), Week 12, 16 and 26|Change From Baseline in Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) Total Score at Week 2, 12, 16, 20 and 26, DLQI is a 10-item questionnaire that measured the impact of skin disease. Each question was evaluated on a 4-point scale (range 0 to 3) where, 0 = not at all, 1= a little, 2= a lot, 3= very much, where higher scores indicated more impact on quality of life. Scores from all 10 questions were added up to give DLQI total score, ranging from 0 (not at all) to 30 (very much). Higher scores indicated more impact on quality of life of participants., Baseline (Day 1), Week 2, 12, 16, 20 and 26|Change From Baseline in EuroQol Quality of Life 5-Dimension 5-Level (EQ-5D-5L) Visual Analog Scale (VAS) Score at Week 12, 16 and 26, The EQ-5D-5L is a self-reported health status questionnaire that consisted of six questions used to calculate a health utility score. There were two components to the EQ-5D-5L: a five-item health state profile that assessed mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression used to obtain an Index Utility Score, as well as a VAS that measured health state. EQ-5D VAS was used to record participant's rating for his/her current health-related quality of life state on a vertical VAS with scores ranging from 0 to 100, where 0 = worst imaginable health state and 100 = best imaginable health state., Baseline (Day 1), Week 12, 16 and 26|Change From Baseline in Patient-Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM) Total Score at Week 12, 16 and 26, POEM was a 7-item participant reported outcome measure used to assess the impact of AD (dryness, itching, flaking, cracking, sleep loss, bleeding and weeping) over the past week. Each item was scored as: no days=0, 1-2 days=1, 3-4 days=2, 5-6 days=3 and every day=4. The item scores were added to provide a total score ranging from 0 to 28, where higher score indicated greater severity., Baseline (Day 1), Week 12, 16 and 26|Change From Baseline in Medical Outcomes Study - Sleep Scale (MOS-Sleep Scale) at Week 12, 16 and 26, The MOS Sleep Scale is a 12-item measure that is segregated into subscales addressing seven sleep domains (i.e. sleep disturbance, snoring, short of breath or headache, adequacy of sleep, somnolence, sleep problems index I and sleep problems index II). An additional single item assessed quantity of sleep. Each of the sleep domains were scored on a range of 0 to 100, and higher scores indicated worse outcomes. The quantity of sleep scores ranged from 0 to 24 (number of hours slept). Change from baseline scores for each individual sleep domain and quantity of sleep are reported in this outcome measure., Baseline (Day 1), Week 12, 16 and 26|Change From Baseline in Skin Pain NRS at Week 2, 12, 16, 20 and 26, The skin pain NRS was a participant reported outcome where participants were asked to rate the ""worst skin pain"" in the past 24 hours on a 11-point scale from 0=no skin pain to 10=worst skin pain imaginable.
