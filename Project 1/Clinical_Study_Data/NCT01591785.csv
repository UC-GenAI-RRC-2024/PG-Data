NCT01591785,Treatment of Staphylococcus Aureus Colonization in Hand Eczema,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01591785,,COMPLETED,"Atopic dermatitis is a chronic disease characterized by itching and eczematous lesions. In adults, eczema commonly localizes to the hands or feet. Several studies have implicated bacterial contamination, especially with Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), to be a factor in atopic dermatitis, as infection with this bacteria correlates with disease severity. No trial to date has investigated how to treat S. aureus infection in adults with hand or hand/foot dermatitis. Using retapamulin ointment in the nose and on the hands or hands/feet, the investigators expect to have a significant clearance rate of s. aureus infection. The investigators believe that treating the bacterial infection along with treating the condition with a topical corticosteroid will significantly decrease the severity of hand/foot dermatitis in our study population.",YES,Hand Eczema|Foot Eczema,DRUG: Retapamulin 1% ointment|DRUG: Placebo,"Number of Participants With PGA of 0 or 1, Physician's Global Assessment PGA 0 = Clear (no inflammatory signs of atopic dermatitis)
