NCT04753034,Study of TER-101 Topical Ointment in Subjects With Atopic Dermatitis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04753034,,COMPLETED,"This Phase 2 study will assess efficacy, safety, and tolerability of TER-101 ointment and vehicle twice daily for 28 days in adult and adolescent subjects with mild to moderate atopic dermatitis.",YES,Atopic Dermatitis,DRUG: TER-101|DRUG: Vehicle,"Percent Change in EASI From Baseline at Day 29, EASI = Eczema Area and Severity Index, EASI combines the assessment of the severity of lesions and the the numerical area affected into a single total score in the range 0 (no disease) to 72 (maximal disease). To calculate the EASI, the sum of the severity rating (0 to 3 with 3 being the most severe) for erythema, induration, lichenification, excoriation are multiplied with value of the area affected and with the percentage of the four body areas., 29 days","Changes in EASI Over Time, EASI combines the assessment of the severity of lesions and the area affected into a single total score in the range 0 (no disease) to 72 (maximal disease).

1. = Almost Clear
2. = Mild
3. = Moderate
4. = Severe, 29 Days|Changes in Itch Over Time, The WI-NRS asks subjects to report their worst itch (maximal intensity) during the last 24 hours on an 11-point NRS, ranging from 0 = ""no itch at all"" to 10 = ""worst itch you can imagine""., 29 days|Tolerability of TER-101 Ointment vs. Vehicle in Subjects With AD, Sum of erythema, itch, and burning at the time of visit compared to baseline measured on a 0 - 3 scale for each component. A score of 0 indicates no erythema, itch or burning.
