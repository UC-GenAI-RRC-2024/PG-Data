NCT03406325,Mast Cell Activation Test in Allergic Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03406325,,COMPLETED,"Activation of mast cells in the immune system is known to cause allergic reactions sometimes with severe systemic symptoms. The investigators have recently developed a blood-based mast cell activation diagnostic test in which levels of functional activation in-vitro in primary cultured mast cells generated from the peripheral blood of single individuals can be assessed. It is the hypothesis that the test can be used to predict the potential state of in-vivo mast cell activation in any individual based on the functional activation profiles exhibited by their cultured mast cells. The investigators now wish to translate their in-vitro findings in a pilot study to disease groups where mast cell activation is expected to be high. These include highly allergic individuals; those with chronic idiopathic urticaria; those with mastocytosis; and those with the mast cell activation syndrome. Furthermore, they will use the functional genomics approach to identify gene expression biomarkers that are correlated with such diseases. The results will be compared with data that have been collected from a cohort of healthy control blood donors.",YES,Asthma|Mastocytosis|Mast Cell Activation Syndrome|Food Allergy|Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria|Anaphylaxis|Eczema,,"Mast Cell Activation Test Results for Validation Group, Mast Cell Activation Test results of high/low level of house dust mite sensitivity by using normal donor cultured mast cells for validation., Mast cells studied after 9 weeks in culture|Evaluation of Patient's Serum for Autoreactivity on Normal Average Responder Mast Cell Activation, Patient's serum was incubated with mast cells derived from normal donors for detection of mast cell activation as evidenced by histamine release., Mast cells studied after 9 weeks in culture|Percentage Histamine Release by Normal Average Responder Mast Cells + Patient's Serum to Assess Autoreactivity, percentage of total histamine release by normal average responder mast cells that had been activated with patient's serum, Mast cells studied after 9 weeks in culture|Percentage Histamine Release by Patient's Mast Cells + Immunoglobulin E (IgE)/Anti-IgE, percentage of total histamine release by patient's mast cells that had been activated with anti-IgE, Mast cells studied after 9 weeks in culture|Percentage of Histamine Release by Patient's Mast Cells + Patient's Serum + Allergen, Percentage of total histamine release when patient's mast cells were activated with patient's own serum and Der p2.
