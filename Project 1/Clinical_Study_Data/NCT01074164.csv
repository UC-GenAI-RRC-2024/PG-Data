NCT01074164,Acupressure in Pruritus for Atopic Dermatitis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01074164,,COMPLETED,The purpose of this study is to see if acupressure will be effective at reducing itch in people with atopic dermatitis (AD).,YES,Atopic Dermatitis,OTHER: Standard-of-care treatment for AD|DEVICE: Accu-patch pellet,"Change in Itch Intensity as Measured by a Change in Visual Analog Scale (VAS) Score, The VAS score assesses itch intensity in subject's with AD. The VAS consists of a 21.5 cm horizontal line with its left and right boundaries marked by vertical lines. The left boundary vertical line is labeled ""Least Itch,"" and the right boundary vertical line is labeled ""Worst Itch."" Subjects are instructed to draw a vertical line across this scale that represents the intensity of itch that they are currently experiencing. Vertical lines drawn by subjects towards the left boundary of the horizontal line are associated with less itch intensity, and vertical lines drawn by subjects towards the right boundary of the horizontal line are associated with worse itch intensity. A ruler is then used to measure distance from the left boundary vertical line to the vertical line drawn by the subject to the nearest millimeter. Possible values range from 0 to 21.5 centimeters, with 0 centimeters associated with less itch intensity and 21.5 cm associated with worse itch intensity., Baseline and 4 weeks","Change in Severity of Atopic Dermatitis (AD) as Measured by a Change in Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) Score, The IGA score is an assessment of AD severity. It is an assessment of the patient's disease state at the time of examination and does not attempt a comparison with any of the patient's previous disease states. Possible scores range from 0 to 5. A score of 0 is associated with no evidence of AD and a score of 5 is associated with severe AD., Baseline and 4 weeks|Change in Severity of Atopic Dermatitis (AD) as Measured by a Change in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI): Area Subscale Score, The EASI is a composite score assessing four key clinical signs of AD and the area of skin involvement in four main body regions (head, trunk, upper limbs, and lower limbs). The 5 EASI subscales are: erythema, infiltration/papulation, excoriation, lichenification, and percent area of skin involvement. For determining area subscale score, the percent area of skin involvement is determined and assigned a score of 0 to 6, where 0 correlates with no skin involvement, 1 represents \< 10% skin involvement, 2 represents 10-29% skin involvement, 3 represents 30-49% skin involvement, 4 represents 50-69% skin involvement, 5 represents 70-89% skin involvement, and 6 represents 90-100% skin involvement. Possible scores range from 0 to 6, where 0 correlates with better disease severity and 6 correlates with worse disease severity.

Exp Dermatol; 10: 11-18., Baseline and 4 weeks|Change in Severity of Atopic Dermatitis (AD) as Measured by a Change in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI): Erythema Subscale Score, The EASI is a composite score assessing four key clinical signs of AD and the area of skin involvement in four main body regions (head, trunk, upper limbs, and lower limbs). The 5 EASI subscales are: erythema, infiltration/papulation, excoriation, lichenification, and percent area of skin involvement. For determining the erythema subscale score, erythema is assessed in each main body region and assigned a score of 0 to 3, where a score of 0 is associated with no expression of the clinical sign and a score of 3 is associated with severe expression of the clinical sign. Possible scores range from 0 to 3, where 0 correlates with better disease severity and 3 correlates with worse disease severity.
