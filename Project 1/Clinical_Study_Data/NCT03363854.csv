NCT03363854,Tralokinumab in Combination With Topical Corticosteroids for Moderate to Severe Atopic Dermatitis - ECZTRA 3,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03363854,,COMPLETED,"Primary objective:

To demonstrate that tralokinumab in combination with topical corticosteroids (TCS) is superior to placebo in combination with TCS in treating moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD).

Secondary objectives:

To evaluate the efficacy of tralokinumab in combination with TCS on severity and extent of AD, itch, and health-related quality of life compared with placebo in combination with TCS.

To assess the safety of tralokinumab in combination with TCS when used to treat moderate-to-severe AD for 32 weeks.",YES,Atopic Dermatitis,DRUG: Tralokinumab|DRUG: Placebo,"Participants With Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) Score of 0 (Clear) or 1 (Almost Clear) at Week 16, IGA is used to evaluate the severity of atopic dermatitis.

Data were reported in the following categories: positive (presence of ADA at baseline and/or presence of ADA at at least 1 post-baseline assessment), perishing (presence of ADA at baseline and absence of ADA at all post-baseline assessments), negative (absence of ADA at all assessments), no post-baseline ADA assessment. Perishing ADAs were not assessed in the continuation treatment period., Week 0 to Week 16, Week 16 to Week 32|Amount of Topical Corticosteroid (TCS) Used Through Week 16 Assuming no TCS Used From the Non-returned Tubes, Assessed as the amount of TCS weighed from previous visits, assuming no TCS was used from the non-returned tubes.
