NCT04605094,Efficacy and Safety Study of the Use of Benralizumab for Patients With Moderate to Severe Atopic Dermatitis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04605094,,TERMINATED,The purpose of the study is to compare the efficacy and safety of benralizumab versus placebo and to compare benralizumab dosing regimens during extension period.,YES,Atopic Dermatitis,BIOLOGICAL: Benralizumab|BIOLOGICAL: Placebo / Benralizumab,"Percentage of Participants With an Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) 0/1 and a Decrease in IGA of ≥2 Points at Week 16 Relative to Baseline, The IGA is an instrument used in clinical studies to rate the severity of AD globally, based on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 = clear; 1 = almost clear; 2 = mild disease; 3 = moderate disease; 4 = severe disease. The IGA used clinical characteristics of erythema, infiltration, papulation, oozing, and crusting as guidelines for the overall severity assessment. A higher score indicated greater severity. A responder at Week 16 was defined as having IGA 0/1 and a decrease in IGA of ≥2 points at Week 16 relative to baseline. Participants who withdrew from the study/required rescue therapy after Day 28 were considered as non-responders from the time these events occurred. Baseline was defined as the last recorded value on or prior to the date of randomization., Baseline (Week 0) and at Week 16","Percentage of Participants Who Experienced 75% Reduction From Baseline in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI-75) at Week 16, The EASI assessed the severity and extent of AD. Severity of 4 AD disease characteristics (erythema, induration/papulation, excoriation \[scratching\], lichenification) each were assessed on a scale of 0 (absent) to 3 (severe) in each of 4 body regions (head/neck, trunk, upper limbs, and lower limbs). Total body total score=sum of the region total scores; ranged from 0 to 72. Participants were classified as responders if they achieved at least 75% reduction from baseline in their EASI total score at Week 16. Participants who withdrew from study/required rescue therapy after Day 28 were non-responders from the time these events occurred. Higher scores indicated a more severe or more extensive condition. Baseline was defined as the last recorded value on or prior to the date of randomization., Baseline (Week 0) and at Week 16|Percentage of Participants Who Experienced 90% Reduction From Baseline in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI-90) at Week 16, The EASI assessed the severity and extent of AD. Severity of 4 AD disease characteristics (erythema, induration/papulation, excoriation \[scratching\], lichenification) each were assessed on a scale of 0 (absent) to 3 (severe) in each of 4 body regions (head/neck, trunk, upper limbs, and lower limbs). Total body total score=sum of the region total scores; ranged from 0 to 72. Participants were classified as responders if they achieved at least 90% reduction from baseline in their EASI total score at Week 16. Participants who withdrew from study/required rescue therapy after Day 28 were non-responders from the time these events occurred. Higher scores indicated a more severe or more extensive condition. Baseline was defined as the last recorded value on or prior to the date of randomization., Baseline (Week 0) and at Week 16|Percentage of Participants With an Improvement of ≥4 or More Points in Peak Pruritus Weekly Score, The peak pruritus numeric rating scale (NRS) was a 1-item daily assessment of the worst itch the participant experienced over the past 24 hours. The score ranged from 0 to 10, with 0 being ""no itch"" and 10 being ""worst itch imaginable"" and so a reduction in score was considered an improvement. A responder was defined as having an improvement of 4 or more points relative to baseline. Participants who withdrew from the study/required rescue therapy after Day 28 were considered as non-responders from the time these events occurred. The Week 16 weekly scores were defined as the average of the daily scores for the 7 days prior to the weekly score., At Week 16",,AstraZeneca,Iqvia Pty Ltd,ALL,"CHILD, ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE2,194,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: QUADRUPLE (PARTICIPANT, CARE_PROVIDER, INVESTIGATOR, OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",D3256C00001,2020-11-12,2022-04-25,2022-09-13,2020-10-27,2023-04-21,2023-08-31,"Research Site, Los Angeles, California, 90025, United States|Research Site, Newport Beach, California, 92663, United States|Research Site, Bridgeport, Connecticut, 06606, United States|Research Site, Fort Myers, Florida, 33912, United States|Research Site, Tampa, Florida, 33606, United States|Research Site, Tampa, Florida, 33607, United States|Research Site, Ypsilanti, Michigan, 48197, United States|Research Site, Portsmouth, New Hampshire, 03801, United States|Research Site, New York, New York, 10029, United States|Research Site, Rochester, New York, 14620, United States|Research Site, Cincinnati, Ohio, 45219, United States|Research Site, Norman, Oklahoma, 73071, United States|Research Site, Sugarloaf, Pennsylvania, 18249, United States|Research Site, Kogarah, 2217, Australia|Research Site, Parkville, 3050, Australia|Research Site, Sippy Downs, 4556, Australia|Research Site, Woolloongabba, 04102, Australia|Research Site, Haskovo, 6300, Bulgaria|Research Site, Pleven, 5800, Bulgaria|Research Site, Sofia, 1000, Bulgaria|Research Site, Sofia, 1431, Bulgaria|Research Site, Brno, 602 00, Czechia|Research Site, Ostrava-Poruba, 708 52, Czechia|Research Site, Ostrava, 702 00, Czechia|Research Site, Pardubice, 530 02, Czechia|Research Site, Praha 10, 100 00, Czechia|Research Site, Praha, 110 00, Czechia|Research Site, Brest Cedex 2, 29609, France|Research Site, Lille Cedex, 59037, France|Research Site, Ansan-si, 15355, Korea, Republic of|Research Site, Daegu, 41944, Korea, Republic of|Research Site, Gwangju, 61453, Korea, Republic of|Research Site, Seongnam-si, 13620, Korea, Republic of|Research Site, Seoul, 04763, Korea, Republic of|Research Site, Seoul, 05278, Korea, Republic of|Research Site, Seoul, 05505, Korea, Republic of|Research Site, Seoul, 06591, Korea, Republic of|Research Site, Seoul, 06973, Korea, Republic of|Research Site, Seoul, 07441, Korea, Republic of|Research Site, Seoul, 5030, Korea, Republic of|Research Site, Yangsan-si, 50612, Korea, Republic of|Research Site, Krakow, 30-033, Poland|Research Site, Lodz, 90-302, Poland|Research Site, Osielsko, 86031, Poland|Research Site, Poznań, 60-214, Poland|Research Site, Warszawa, 01-262, Poland|Research Site, Alicante, 03010, Spain|Research Site, Barcelona, 08041, Spain|Research Site, Cordoba, 14004, Spain|Research Site, Madrid, 28040, Spain|Research Site, Manises, 46940, Spain","Study Protocol, https://storage.googleapis.com/ctgov2-large-docs/94/NCT04605094/Prot_000.pdf|Statistical Analysis Plan, https://storage.googleapis.com/ctgov2-large-docs/94/NCT04605094/SAP_001.pdf"
