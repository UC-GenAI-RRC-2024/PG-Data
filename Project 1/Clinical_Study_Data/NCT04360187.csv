NCT04360187,Crisaborole for Chinese and Japanese Subjects (≥2 Years of Age) With Mild to Moderate Atopic Dermatitis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04360187,,COMPLETED,"This study is a phase 3, randomized, double blind and vehicle study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Crisaborole ointment, 2% in Chinese and Japanese subjects with mild to moderate atopic dermatitis involving at least 5% treatable BSA. Eligible subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to one of 2 treatment groups (Crisaborole BID, Vehicle BID, respectively).",YES,Atopic Dermatitis,DRUG: Crisaborole Ointment|DRUG: Crisaborole Placebo Vehicle,"Percent Change From Baseline in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) Total Score at Day 29, The EASI quantifies the severity of a participant's AD based on both severity of lesion clinical signs and the percent of body surface area (BSA) affected. EASI is a composite scoring of the degree of erythema, induration/papulation, excoriation, and lichenification (each scored separately) for each of four body regions, with adjustment for the percent of BSA involved for each body region and for the proportion of the body region to the whole body. Total EASI score ranged from 0.0 to 72.0, higher scores = greater severity of AD., Baseline, Day 29|Percentage of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (AEs) or Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), An adverse event was considered as a treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) if the event started after the first dose of treatment regardless of whether a similar event of equal or greater severity existed in the baseline period. SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. AEs are classified according to the severity in 3 categories a) mild - AEs does not interfere with participant's usual function b) moderate - AEs interferes to some extent with participant's usual function c) severe - AEs interferes significantly with participant's usual function., Baseline up to Day 60|Percentage of Participants With Clinically Significant Changes From Baseline in Clinical Laboratory Parameters, Laboratory parameters included: hematology and chemistry.
