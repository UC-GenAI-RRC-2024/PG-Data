NCT01756898,"Study to Evaluate the Efficacy, Safety and Pharmacokinetics of ASB17061 Capsules in Adult Subjects With Atopic Dermatitis",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01756898,,COMPLETED,"The purpose of this research study is to gather scientific information about the effectiveness of the study drug, ASB17061 capsules, when compared to placebo in adult subjects with atopic dermatitis.",YES,Atopic Dermatitis,DRUG: 5 mg ASB17061|DRUG: Placebo|DRUG: 10 mg ASB17061|DRUG: 20 mg ASB17061,"Number of Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) Responders at Day 29 Following Treatment With ASB17061 Capsules or Placebo in Adults With Atopic Dermatitis, Participants with an IGA score of 0 or 1 were considered IGA responders. The investigator provided an overall assessment of disease severity using the IGA, which consists of a 6-point scale from a minimum of 0 and a maximum of 6. Higher scores indicate a worse outcome and lower scores indicate a better outcome. (0 = clear; 1 = almost clear; 2 = mild disease; 3 = moderate disease, 4 = severe disease; and 5 = very severe disease)., Baseline up to 29 days after initial dose.|Number of Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) Responders By Subgroup at Day 29 Following Treatment With ASB17061 Capsules or Placebo in Adults With Atopic Dermatitis, Participants with an IGA score of 0 or 1 were considered IGA responders. The investigator provided an overall assessment of disease severity using the IGA which consists of a 6-point scale from the minimum of 0 to a maximum of 6. Higher scores indicate increasing severity.. (0 = clear; 1 = almost clear; 2 = mild disease; 3 = moderate disease, 4 = severe disease; and 5 = very severe disease) and an overall assessment of the disease severity of the entire body using the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI). A composite index, the EASI has a minimum score of 0 (clear) and a maximum score of 72 (very severe); A value less than 15 indicates less severe, and 15 or greater indicates more severe. Lichenification was evaluated on a scale of 0 (none) as the minimum to 3 (severe) as the maximum, and the score of each body region was summed (0 to 12). A percent body surface area (BSA) involved less than 15 is less severe and 15 or greater more severe., Baseline up to 29 days after initial dose.","Mean Change From Baseline in Eczema Area and Severity Index Score (EASI) Following Treatment With ASB17061 Capsules or Placebo in Adult Participants With Atopic Dermatitis at Day 29, The investigator provided an overall assessment of the disease severity of the entire body using the EASI. A composite index, the EASI has a minimum score of 0 (clear) and a maximum score of 72 (very severe); with a negative value indicating decreasing severity of eczema compared to baseline and a decreasing change in the EASI score. A negative value is an indication of a decrease in individual scores., Baseline up to 29 days after initial dose.|Mean Change From Baseline in The Percentage of Body Surface Area (BSA) Involved Following Treatment With ASB17061 Capsules or Placebo in Adult Participants With Atopic Dermatitis at Day 29, Participants' body surface area affected by atopic dermatitis was assessed for the change in percentage after treatment. A negative value indicates a decrease in the percent of body surface area (BSA) involved. A negative value is an indication of a decrease in individual scores., Baseline up to 29 days after initial dose.|Mean Change From Baseline in Pruritus Score Following Treatment With ASB17061 Capsules or Placebo in Adult Participants With Atopic Dermatitis at Day 29, Participants assessed the overall intensity of pruritus using a 4-point scale with 0 as the minimum and 3 as the maximum. (0 = absent; 1 = mild; 2 = moderate; and 3 = severe) A negative value indicates a decreasing change in the pruritus score. A negative value is an indication of a decrease in individual scores., Baseline up to 29 days after initial dose.|Mean Change From Baseline in Insomnia Score Following Treatment With ASB17061 Capsules or Placebo in Adult Participants With Atopic Dermatitis at Day 29, Participants assessed the extent of their insomnia using an 11-point scale ranging from the minimum, 0 (no insomnia) to the maximum, 10 (severe insomnia). A negative value indicates a decreasing change in the insomnia score. A negative value is an indication of a decrease in individual scores., Baseline up to 29 days after initial dose.|Plasma Concentrations of ASB17061 and ASB17584 Over Time Following Treatment With ASB17061 Capsules in Adult Participants With Atopic Dermatitis, Baseline (Day 1 Predose) up to Day 8, Day 15, and Day 22 at 0 to 2.5 hours, 2.5 to 5 hours, 5 to 10 hours, up to Day 29 at 24-32 hours postdose.|Minimum Observed Plasma Concentration (Cmin) of ASB17061 and ASB17584 Following Treatment With ASB17061 Capsules in Adult Participants With Atopic Dermatitis, The minimum observed plasma drug concentration (Cmin) of ASB17061 and ASB17584 in the 4-week Treatment Period were estimated from the actual dosing records., Baseline (Day 1 Predose) up to Day 8, Day 15, and Day 22 at 0 to 2.5 hours, 2.5 to 5 hours, 5 to 10 hours, up to Day 29 at 24-32 hours postdose.|Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of ASB17061 and ASB17584 Following Treatment With ASB17061 Capsules in Adult Subjects With Atopic Dermatitis, Pharmacokinetic (PK) metrics of ASB17061 and ASB17584 maximum observed plasma drug concentration (Cmax) in the 4-week Treatment Period were estimated from the individual PK parameters and the actual dosing records., Baseline (Day 1 Predose) up to Day 8, Day 15, and Day 22 at 0 to 2.5 hours, 2.5 to 5 hours, 5 to 10 hours, up to Day 29 at 24-32 hours postdose.|Average Plasma Concentration (Cavg) of ASB17061 and ASB17584 Following Treatment With ASB17061 Capsules in Adult Participants With Atopic Dermatitis, The average plasma drug concentration (Cmin) of ASB17061 and ASB17584 in the 4-week Treatment Period were estimated from the actual dosing records., Baseline up to Predose, up to 0 to 2.5 hours, up to 2.5 to 5 hours, up to 5 to 10 hours, up to Day 29 (24-32 hours).|Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAE) Following Treatment With ASB17061 Capsules or Placebo in Adult Participants With Atopic Dermatitis, A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) was defined as an AE that emerges during treatment, having been absent at pre-treatment; or reemerges during treatment, having been present at baseline but stopped prior to treatment; or worsens in severity during treatment after initiating the study drug., Baseline up to Day 57 follow-up visit post dose.",,"Daiichi Sankyo, Inc.",,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE2,370,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: DOUBLE (PARTICIPANT, INVESTIGATOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",ASBI 704,2012-11-28,2014-01-14,2014-01-14,2012-12-28,2020-11-16,2021-02-16,"Birmingham, Alabama, 35233, United States|Phoenix, Arizona, 85018, United States|Rogers, Arkansas, 72758, United States|Encino, California, 91436, United States|Fremont, California, 94538, United States|San Diego, California, 92122, United States|Temecula, California, 92592, United States|Denver, Colorado, 80220, United States|Miami, Florida, 33144, United States|Miami, Florida, 33175, United States|Miramar, Florida, 33027, United States|Saint Augustine, Florida, 32086, United States|South Tampa, Florida, 33609, United States|Tampa, Florida, 33609, United States|Tampa, Florida, 33613, United States|Savannah, Georgia, 31405, United States|Boise, Idaho, 83704, United States|Overland Park, Kansas, 66215, United States|Crowley, Louisiana, 70526, United States|Bay City, Michigan, 48706, United States|Clinton Township, Michigan, 48038, United States|Fort Gratiot, Michigan, 48059, United States|Berlin, New Jersey, 08009, United States|Verona, New Jersey, 07044, United States|Stony Brook, New York, 11790, United States|Raleigh, North Carolina, 27612, United States|Sylvania, Ohio, 43560, United States|Lake Oswego, Oregon, 97035, United States|Portland, Oregon, 97239, United States|Johnston, Rhode Island, 02919, United States|Arlington, Texas, 76011, United States|College Station, Texas, 77845, United States|Pflugerville, Texas, 78660, United States|San Antonio, Texas, 78229, United States|Webster, Texas, 77598, United States|Draper, Utah, 84020, United States|West Jordan, Utah, 84088, United States|Henrico, Virginia, 23233, United States|Norfolk, Virginia, 23507, United States|Spokane, Washington, 99204-4880, United States",
