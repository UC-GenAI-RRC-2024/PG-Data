NCT03747575,A Study to Assess the Efficacy and Safety of MSTT1041A in Participants With Moderate to Severe Atopic Dermatitis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03747575,,COMPLETED,"This study will assess the efficacy and safety of MSTT1041A (astegolimab) in participants with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis (AD). The study consists of a screening period, a 16-week treatment period, and an 8-week follow-up period.",YES,Atopic Dermatitis,DRUG: MSTT1041A|DRUG: Placebo,"Percent Change of Total Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) Score, The Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) is a standardized instrument to evaluate the extent and severity of atopic dermatitis. An area score comprised of the percentage of skin affected by eczema for each of 4 body regions (head/neck, trunk, upper extremities, and lower extremities) is calculated with 0 = none, 1 = 1-9%, 2 = 10-29%, 3 = 30-49%, 4 = 50-69%, 5 = 70-89%, and 6 = 90-100%. Severity is scored for each of the 4 body regions by the summation of the intensity scores for 4 signs (redness, thickness, scratching, and lichenification), with 0 = none/absent, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, and 3 = severe. The minimum final EASI score is 0 and the maximum score is 72., Baseline, Week 16","Proportion of Participants Who Achieve Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) Response of 0 or 1, Baseline, Week 16|Proportion of Participants Who Achieve >/=75% Reduction From Baseline in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI-75) Score, Baseline, Week 16|Percent Change in Pruritus as Assessed by a Numeric Rating Scale (NRS), The Peak Pruritis Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) is a single-item patient-reported outcome (PRO) of itch severity rated on a scale of 0-10, with 0 = no itch and 10 = worst itch imaginable for the prior 24-hour period., Baseline, Week 16|Percent Change in Body Surface Area (BSA) With Atopic Dermatitis (AD) Involvement, Baseline, Week 16|Percent Change in Disease Severity as Assessed by SCORing Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD), SCORAD is a tool used to assess the extent and severity of eczema based on three aspects of disease severity: extent, intensity, and a subjective (PRO) symptoms.
