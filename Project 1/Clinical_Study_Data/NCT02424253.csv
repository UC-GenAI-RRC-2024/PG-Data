NCT02424253,A Study to Determine the Efficacy of ZPL-3893787 in Subjects With Atopic Dermatitis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02424253,,COMPLETED,"This was a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, parallel group study in approximately 90 subjects with moderate-severe AD Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) ≥12 and ≤ 48 (0-72 scale). Following a run-in subjects were randomized to receive either oral 30 mg ZPL-3893787 once daily (od) or placebo od for 8 weeks (56 days).",YES,Atopic Dermatitis,DRUG: ZPL-3893787|DRUG: Placebo,"Change From Baseline in the Numerical Rating Score (NRS) for Pruritus (Worst Itch), The participant used the Pruritus NRS to rate his or her worst itch in the previous 12 hours. This was assessed twice daily (in the morning soon after rising and the evening prior to retiring) and recorded in the eDiary. The scale ranges from 0 (no itching) to 10 (itching as bad as can be imagined).

If only 1 measurement was collected on a particular day, that score was counted as the worst measurement., Baseline to Week 8","Change From Baseline in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) Score, The EASI is a validated tool used to measure the severity and extent of atopic eczema over 4 body regions (head and neck, upper limbs, trunk, and lower limbs). The intensity of a representative area of eczema and the approximate percentage affected by eczema are calculated for each region. A representative area of eczema is selected for each body region. The intensity of redness (erythema), thickness (induration, papulation, and edema), scratching (excoriation), and lichenification (lined skin) of eczema is assessed as:

0 - None

1. - Mild
2. - Moderate
3. - Severe The total score incorporates the extent of body regions affected. Scores range from 0 to 72 with higher scores indicating more severe eczema.

Total score is calculated by summing the EASI scores of 6 symptoms across 4 body regions, Baseline to Week 8",,Ziarco Pharma Ltd,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE2,98,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: QUADRUPLE (PARTICIPANT, CARE_PROVIDER, INVESTIGATOR, OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",ZPL389/101,2015-05-18,2016-01,2016-02-03,2015-04-23,2021-04-20,2021-06-10,"Belgium Study Site, Brussels, Belgium|Belgium Study Site, Leuven, Belgium|Belgium Study Site, Liege, Belgium|German Study Site, Goch, Germany|German Study Site, Hamburg, Germany|German Study Site, Hannover, Germany|German Study Site, Mainz, Germany|German Study Site, Munster, Germany|Polish Study Site, Białystok, Poland|Polish Study Site, Gdansk, Poland|Polish Study Site, Lodz, Poland|Polish Study Site, Poznan, Poland|Polish Study Site, Tarnow, Poland|UK Study Centre, Blackpool, United Kingdom|UK Study Centre, Cannock, United Kingdom|UK Study Centre, Leeds, United Kingdom|UK Study Centre, Manchester, United Kingdom",
