NCT03627767,Study to Investigate Efficacy and Safety of PF-04965842 in Subjects Aged 12 Years and Over With Moderate to Severe Atopic Dermatitis With the Option of Rescue Treatment in Flaring Subjects,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03627767,,COMPLETED,"B7451014 is a Phase 3 study to investigate PF-04965842 in patients aged 12 years and over with a minimum body weight of 40 kg who have moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. Subjects responding well to an initial open-label 12 week treatment of PF-04965842 (200 mg) taken orally once daily (QD) will be identified and randomized in a double-blind manner to receive 200 mg QD PF-04965842, 100 mg QD PF-04965842, or QD placebo. Efficacy and safety of 2 doses of PF-04965842 will be evaluated relative to placebo over 40 weeks. Subjects experiencing significant worsening of their symptoms, i.e., protocol-defined flare, enter 12 weeks rescue treatment and receive 200 mg PF-04965842 together with a marketed topical medicine. Eligible patients will have the option to enter a long-term extension study after completing the initial 12 week treatment, the 12 week rescue treatment, and the 40 week blinded treatment.",YES,"Dermatitis|Dermatitis, Atopic|Eczema|Skin Diseases|Skin Diseases, Genetic|Genetic Diseases, Inborn|Skin Diseases, Eczematous|Hypersensitivity|Hypersensitivity, Immediate|Immune System Diseases",DRUG: PF-04965842 100 mg|DRUG: PF-04965842 200 mg|DRUG: Placebo,"Percentage of Participants With Loss of Response: Double-blind (DB) Period, Percentage of participants with loss of response requiring rescue treatment during double blind period was determined. Loss of response denoted as flare and was define as a loss of at least 50% of EASI total score at Week 12 and with an IGA score of 2 or higher. EASI quantifies severity of participant's atopic dermatitis (AD) based on both severity of lesion clinical signs and % of body surface area (BSA) affected. EASI is a composite scoring by AD clinical evaluator of degree of erythema, induration/papulation, excoriation, and lichenification for each of 4 body regions. EASI total score range from 0.0 to 72.0, with higher scores representing greater severity of AD. IGA assesses severity of AD on 5-point scale (0 to 4, higher scores = more severity), reflecting global consideration of erythema, induration and scaling.
