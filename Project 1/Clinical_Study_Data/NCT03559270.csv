NCT03559270,A Study of Baricitinib (LY3009104) in Participants With Moderate to Severe Atopic Dermatitis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03559270,BREEZE-AD6,TERMINATED,This open-label study will evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of baricitinib in adult participants with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis (AD).,YES,Atopic Dermatitis,DRUG: Baricitinib,"Percentage of Participants Achieving Eczema Area and Severity Index 75 (EASI75), The EASI assesses objective physician estimates of 2 dimensions of atopic dermatitis - disease extent and clinical signs affected: 0 = 0%; 1 = 1-9%; 2 = 10-29%; 3 = 30-49%; 4 = 50-69%; 5 = 70-89%; 6 = 90-100% and the severity of 4 clinical signs: (1) erythema, (2) edema/papulation, (3) excoriation, and (4) lichenification each on a scale of 0 to 3 (0 = none, absent; 1 = mild; 2 = moderate; 3 = severe) at 4 body sites (head/neck, trunk, upper limbs, and lower limbs). Half scores are allowed between severities 1, 2, and 3. The final EASI score was obtained by weight-averaging these 4 scores and will range from 0 to 72 (severe). The EASI75 is defined as a ≥ 75% improvement from baseline in the EASI score.

The results were analyzed using non-responder imputation (NRI). All participants who either discontinued the study treatment or discontinued the study for any reason at any time were defined as non-responders for the NRI analysis for categorical variables such as EASI75., Week 16","Percentage of Participants Achieving Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) of 0 or 1, The IGA measures the investigator's global assessment of the participant's overall severity of their atopic dermatitis (AD), based on a static, numeric 5-point scale from 0 (clear skin) to 4 (severe disease). The score is based on an overall assessment of the degree of erythema, papulation/induration, oozing/crusting, and lichenification.

The results were analyzed using NRI. All participants who either discontinued the study treatment or discontinued the study for any reason at any time were defined as non-responders for the NRI analysis for categorical variables such as IGA 0/1., Week 16|Percentage of Participants Achieving a Body Surface Area (BSA) of ≤3%, The BSA affected by AD will be assessed for 4 separate body regions: head and neck, trunk (including genital region), upper extremities, and lower extremities (including the buttocks). Each body region will be assessed for disease extent ranging from 0% to 100% involvement. BSA was calculated using the participant's palm using the 1% rule, 1 palm was equivalent to 1% with estimates of the number of palms it takes to cover the affected AD area. Maximum number of palms were 10 palms for head and neck (10%), 20 palms for upper extremities (20%), 30 palms for trunk, including axilla and groin (30%), 40 palms for lower extremities, including buttocks (40%). Percent of BSA for a body region was calculated as = total number of palms in a body region \* % surface area equivalent to 1 palm. Overall percent BSA of all 4 body regions ranges from 0% to 100 % with higher values representing greater severity of AD., Week 16|Percentage of Participants Achieving a ≥4-Point Improvement in Itch Numeric Rating Scale (NRS), The NRS is a participant-administered, 11-point horizontal scale anchored at 0 and 10, with 0 representing ""no itch"" and 10 representing ""worst itch imaginable."" Overall severity of a participant's itching is indicated by selecting the number, using a daily diary, that best describes the worst level of itching in the past 24 hours., Week 16",,Eli Lilly and Company,Incyte Corporation,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,374,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: NON_RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: SINGLE_GROUP|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,17064|I4V-MC-JAIX,2018-06-27,2021-10-14,2022-06-13,2018-06-18,2022-10-11,2022-11-08,"University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama, 35233, United States|Johnson Dermatology, Fort Smith, Arkansas, 72916, United States|California Dermatology & Clinical Research Institute, Encinitas, California, 92024, United States|First OC Dermatology, Fountain Valley, California, 92708, United States|Center For Dermatology Clinical Research, Inc., Fremont, California, 94538, United States|Keck School of Medicine University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California, 90033, United States|Wallace Medical Group, Inc., Los Angeles, California, 90056, United States|University of California Davis-Dermatology, Sacramento, California, 95816, United States|Medical Center For Clinical Research, San Diego, California, 92108, United States|University Clinical Trials, Inc., San Diego, California, 92123, United States|Southern California Dermatology, Inc., Santa Ana, California, 92701, United States|Clinical Science Institute, Santa Monica, California, 90404, United States|Care Access Research-Walnut Creek, Walnut Creek, California, 94598, United States|GWU/Medical Faculty Associates, Washington, District of Columbia, 20037, United States|Solutions Through Advanced Research, Inc., Jacksonville, Florida, 32256, United States|Olympian Clinical Research, Largo, Florida, 33770, United States|Miami Dermatology and Laser Research, Miami, Florida, 33173, United States|Riverchase Dermatology and Cosmetic Surgery, Pembroke Pines, Florida, 33028, United States|University of South Florida, Tampa, Florida, 33612, United States|ForCare Clinical Research, Tampa, Florida, 33613-1244, United States|Dermatologic Surgery Specialists, PC, Macon, Georgia, 31217, United States|Advanced Medical Research, Sandy Springs, Georgia, 30328, United States|Advanced Clinical Research LLC, Meridian, Idaho, 83642, United States|Northwestern University, Chicago, Illinois, 60611, United States|University Dermatology, Darien, Illinois, 60561, United States|Arlington Dermatology, Rolling Meadows, Illinois, 60008, United States|Dawes Fretzin Clinical Research Group, LLC, Indianapolis, Indiana, 46250, United States|The Indiana Clinical Trials Center, Plainfield, Indiana, 46168, United States|The South Bend Clinic Center for Research, South Bend, Indiana, 46617, United States|Forefront Research, Louisville, Kentucky, 40241, United States|Dermatology and Skin Cancer Specialists, Rockville, Maryland, 20850, United States|Tufts Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts, 02111, United States|Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, 02115, United States|Great Lakes Research Group, Inc., Bay City, Michigan, 48706, United States|Central Dermatology PC, Saint Louis, Missouri, 63117, United States|Skin Specialists, P.C, Omaha, Nebraska, 68144, United States|Icahn Sch of Med at Mt.
