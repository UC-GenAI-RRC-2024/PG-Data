NCT03260595,A Study of Crisaborole Ointment 2% in Adult Japanese Healthy Subjects and Adult Japanese Subjects With Mild To Moderate Atopic Dermatitis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03260595,,COMPLETED,"This is a Phase 1 parallel-cohort study of crisaborole ointment 2% to evaluate the skin irritation potential in adult Japanese healthy subjects in Cohort 1, and to evaluate the safety, tolerability and PK in adult Japanese subjects with mild to moderate AD in Cohort 2.",YES,Healthy|Atopic Dermatitis,DRUG: Crisaborole ointment 2%|DRUG: Vehicle,"Cohort 1: Skin Irritation Index, The skin irritation index is a common measure of skin irritation potential (safety criteria) of investigational product and derived using skin irritation scores. Individual skin irritation score ranges from 0-4, where 0 = no reaction, 0.5 = mild erythema, 1 = erythema, 2 = erythema with edema and papula, 3 = erythema with edema, papula and small water blister, 4 = large water blister, higher score indicates more skin irritation. For each investigational product, the skin irritation index was calculated as the sum of the maximum individual skin irritation scores divided by the number of evaluable participants and multiplied by 100, which ranged from 0 to 400; where, lower score indicated less skin irritation and higher score indicated more skin irritation., Day 3 to 4|Cohort 2: Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (AEs) And Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Treatment-emergent were events between first dose of study drug and up to 28 days after last dose of study drug (up to Day 36) that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pre-treatment state. AEs included both SAEs and non-serious AEs., Baseline up to Day 36|Cohort 2: Number of Participants With Clinically Significant Vital Signs Abnormalities, Vital signs included pulse rate and blood pressure. Clinical significance of vital signs was determined at the investigator's discretion., Baseline up to end of treatment (Day 8)|Cohort 2: Number of Participants With Laboratory Tests Abnormalities, Laboratory tests abnormalities included: hematology (haemoglobin\[Hb\], haematocrit and erythrocytes\<0.8\*lower limit of normal\[LLN\]; erythrocyte mean corpuscular volume, erythrocyte mean corpuscular Hb and erythrocyte mean corpuscular Hb concentration \<0.9\*LLN and \>1.1\*upper limit of normal\[ULN\]; platelets \<0.5\*LLN and \>1.75\*ULN; leukocytes \<0.6\*LLN and \>1.5\*ULN; lymphocytes/leukocytes\[%\], neutrophils/leukocytes\[%\] \<0.8\*LLN and \>1.2\*ULN; basophils/leukocytes\[%\], eosinophils/leukocytes\[%\], monocytes/leukocytes\[% \]\>1.2\*ULN); clinical chemistry(bilirubin\>1.5\*ULN; aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase\>3.0\*ULN; protein and albumin\<0.8\*LLN and \>1.2\*ULN; urea nitrogen and creatinine \>1.3\*ULN; urate\>1.2\*ULN; sodium \<0.95\*LLN and \>1.05\*ULN; potassium, chloride and calcium \<0.9\*LLN and \>1.1\*ULN; fasting glucose \<0.6\*LLN and \>1.5\*ULN); and urinalysis (pH \<4.5 and \>8; glucose, ketones, protein, Hb, urobilinogen, bilirubin, nitrite and leukocyte esterase \>=1)., Baseline up to end of treatment (Day 8)|Cohort 2: Number of Participants With Clinically Significant Electrocardiogram (ECG) Abnormalities, Criteria for clinically significant ECG abnormalities included: QT interval \>=500 milliseconds (msec); QT interval corrected using the Fridericia's formula (QTcF) \>=450 msec to \<480 msec, \>=480 msec and \>=500 msec; increase from baseline in QTcF interval \>=30 msec to \<60 msec and \>=60 msec., Baseline up to end of treatment (Day 8)","Cohort 1: Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (AEs) And Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Treatment-emergent were events between first dose of study drug and up to 28 days after last dose of study drug (up to Day 29) that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pre-treatment state. AEs included both SAEs and non-serious AEs., Baseline up to Day 29|Cohort 2: Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of Crisaborole and Its Identified Main Oxidative Metabolites, AN7602 and AN8323 were the main identified oxidative metabolites of Crisaborole., Pre-dose, 3, 12 and 24 hours post-dose on Day 1 and Day 8|Cohort 2: Time to Reach Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration (Tmax) of Crisaborole and Its Metabolites, AN7602 and AN8323 were the main identified oxidative metabolites of Crisaborole., Pre-dose, 3, 12 and 24 hours post-dose on Day 1 and Day 8|Cohort 2: Area Under the Plasma Concentration-Time Curve From Time Zero Until the Last Measurable Concentration (AUClast) of Crisaborole and Its Identified Main Oxidative Metabolites, AN7602 and AN8323 were the main identified oxidative metabolites of Crisaborole., Pre-dose, 3, 12 and 24 hours post-dose on Day 1 and Day 8|Cohort 2: Area Under the Plasma Concentration-Time Curve From Time Zero to the 24 Hours Post-Dose (AUC24) of Crisaborole and Its Identified Main Oxidative Metabolites (AN7602 and AN8323), AN7602 and AN8323 were the main identified oxidative metabolites of Crisaborole., Pre-dose, 3, 12 and 24 hours post-dose on Day 1 and Day 8|Cohort 2: Area Under the Plasma Concentration-Time Curve From Time Zero to Tau (12 Hours Dosing Interval) (AUCtau) of Crisaborole and Its Identified Main Oxidative Metabolites, AN7602 and AN8323 were the main identified oxidative metabolites of Crisaborole.
