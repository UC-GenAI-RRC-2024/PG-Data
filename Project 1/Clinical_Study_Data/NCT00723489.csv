NCT00723489,Immune Response to Yellow Fever Vaccination in Adults With Atopic Dermatitis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00723489,,COMPLETED,"The main objective of the Atopic Dermatitis and Vaccinia Immunization Network (ADVN) is to reduce the risk of the fatal reaction, eczema vaccinatum (EV), to the smallpox vaccination in those with atopic dermatitis (AD). Since vaccination with live vaccinia virus (VV) in individuals with AD increases the risk of EV, a yellow fever vaccine was chosen. The purpose of this study is to determine the immune response to a yellow fever vaccine in adults with AD.",YES,Atopic Dermatitis,BIOLOGICAL: Live Yellow Fever Vaccine (YFV-17D)|DRUG: YFV-17D Placebo,"Comparison of Anti-YF Antibody Levels by Measurement of Log10 Neutralization Index (LNI): YFV-17D TC- (AD) Participants Compared to YFV-17D TC- (Non-AD) Participants, Log10 Neutralization Index (LNI) is the Log10 difference in virus titer (measurement of amount of virus) between pre-vaccination and post-vaccination. An LNI greater than or equal to 0.7 suggests that a person has active immunity against Yellow Fever virus., 30 days after Yellow Fever (YF) immunization (Acceptable Blood Draw Range: Day 28 - Day 35 after YF immunization)|Comparison of Anti-YF Antibody Levels by Measurement of Log10 Neutralization Index (LNI): YFV-17D SC - (AD) Participants Compared to YFV-17D SC- (Non-AD) Participants, Log10 Neutralization Index (LNI) is the Log10 difference in virus titer (measurement of amount of virus) between pre-vaccination and post-vaccination. An LNI greater than or equal to 0.7 suggests that a person has active immunity against Yellow Fever virus., 30 days after YF immunization (Acceptable Blood Draw Range: Day 28 - Day 35 after Yellow Fever immunization)|Comparison of Anti-YF Antibody Levels by Measurement of Log10 Neutralizing Titer 50 (NT50): YFV-17D TC - (AD) Participants Compared to YFV-17D TC - (Non - AD) Participants, Neutralization titer (NT50) is the dilution of serum (antibody) that results in a 50% reduction in the amount of virus. A higher NT50 number reflects the presence of more protective antibody levels against the Yellow Fever virus. Some studies have used an NT50 titer of 1:10 or 1:20 as the minimum level to suggest that a person has active immunity against the Yellow Fever virus., 30 days after Yellow Fever (YF) immunization (Acceptable Blood Draw Range: Day 28 - Day 35 after YF immunization)|Comparison of Anti-YF Antibody Levels by Measurement of Log10 Neutralizing Titer 50 (NT50): YFV-17D SC - (AD) Participants Compared to YFV-17D SC - (Non-AD) Participants, Neutralization titer (NT50) is the dilution of serum (antibody) that results in a 50% reduction in the amount of virus.
