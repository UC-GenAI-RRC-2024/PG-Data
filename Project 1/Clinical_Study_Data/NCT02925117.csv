NCT02925117,A Study to Evaluate ABT-494 (Upadacitinib) in Adults With Moderate to Severe Atopic Dermatitis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02925117,,COMPLETED,The objective of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of multiple doses of upadacitinib monotherapy versus placebo in the treatment of adults with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis (AD).,YES,Atopic Dermatitis,DRUG: Upadacitinib|DRUG: Placebo,"Percent Change From Baseline in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) Score at Week 16, EASI is a tool used to measure the extent (area) and severity of atopic eczema based on assessments of the head/neck, trunk, upper limbs and lower limbs. For each region the area score is recorded as the percentage of skin affected by eczema. For each region, the severity score is calculated as the sum of the intensity scores (scored as none \[0\], mild \[1\], moderate \[2\], or severe \[3\]) for Redness (erythema, inflammation), Thickness (induration, papulation, swelling - acute eczema), Scratching (excoriation), and Lichenification (lined skin, prurigo nodules - chronic eczema).

The total EASI score for each region is calculated by multiplying the severity score by the area score, with adjustment for the proportion of the body region to the whole body. The final EASI score is the sum of the 4 region scores and ranges from 0 to 72 where higher scores represent worse disease; a negative change from baseline indicates improvement., Baseline and Week 16","Percentage of Participants Who Achieved a 75% Reduction in EASI Score (EASI 75) at Week 16, EASI is a tool to measure the extent and severity of atopic eczema based on assessments of the head/neck, trunk, upper limbs and lower limbs. For each region the percentage of skin affected, and the severity of eczema (scored as none \[0\], mild \[1\], moderate \[2\], or severe \[3\]) for redness, thickness, scratching, and lichenification are assessed. The EASI score is the sum of the scores for each region and ranges from 0 to 72, where higher scores represent worse disease.

An EASI 75 response is defined as participants with at least a 75% reduction (improvement) in EASI score relative to the Baseline value.

* 0: Clear (No inflammatory signs of atopic dermatitis)
* 1: Almost Clear (Just perceptible erythema and just perceptible papulation/infiltration)
* 2: Mild (Mild erythema and mild papulation/infiltration)
* 3: Moderate (Moderate erythema and moderate papulation/infiltration)
* 4: Severe (Severe erythema and severe papulation/infiltration with or without oozing/crusting)

The percentage of participants with a score of 0 or 1 at Week 16 is reported., Week 16|Percent Change From Baseline to Weeks 2, 8, and 16 in Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale (NRS), Participants were asked to rate pruritus (itch) in the past 24 hours on a daily basis using a scale from 0 to 10, with 0 being no itch and 10 being the worst imaginable itch. The percent change from Baseline at each week was calculated from a rolling weekly average., Baseline and Weeks 2, 8, and 16|Percent Change From Baseline in EASI Score at Week 8, EASI is a tool used to measure the extent (area) and severity of atopic eczema based on assessments of the head/neck, trunk, upper limbs and lower limbs.

Participants answer the 10 questions on a scale from 0 (not at all) to 3 (very much). The DLQI is calculated by summing the scores of the 10 questions, resulting in a maximum of 30 and a minimum of 0 with higher scores indicating more impaired quality of life. A score of 0 or 1 means that the disease has no effect at all.

Dermatology Life Quality Index outcomes were defined but are not reported because of an error in the programming of the electronic device used to administer the questionnaire that precluded determination of these outcomes., Weeks 8 and 16|Change From Baseline in DLQI at Weeks 8 and 16, The DLQI is a 10-item questionnaire that asks participants to evaluate the degree that psoriasis has affected their quality of life in the last week in the following 6 aspects: symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure, work or school activities, personal relationships and treatment related feelings.
