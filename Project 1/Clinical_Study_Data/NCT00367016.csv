NCT00367016,Immunologic Basis of Anti-IgE Therapy (Study II: On Patients With Asthma),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00367016,Xolair,COMPLETED,"The purpose of this study is to look at measures that will help scientists understand the way Omalizumab, an FDA-approved anti-allergy medication, works.",YES,Asthma|Allergic Rhinitis|Atopic Dermatitis,DRUG: Omalizumab|DRUG: Placebo,"FcεRI (High Affinity Receptor) Levels at 3 Months, Skin biopsies were collected from patients after 0 (pre), 3 (pos1) and 6 (pos2) months of omalizumab (P11, P36, P42) or placebo (P7 and P38) treatment. The skin was fixed and the paraffin-embedded sections were stained for high affinity receptors. The average numbers of positively stained cells in each field were counted under a microscope at 400X magnification., 3 months|FcεRI (High Affinity Receptor) Levels at 6 Months, Skin biopsies were collected from patients after 0 (pre), 3 (pos1) and 6 (pos2) months of omalizumab (P11, P36, P42) or placebo (P7 and P38) treatment. The skin was fixed and the paraffin-embedded sections were stained for high affinity receptors. The average numbers of positively stained cells in each field were counted under a microscope at 400X magnification., 6 months","Total Sera IgE Levels at 6 Months, Total sera IgE levels are increased upon anti-IgE treatment. Sera from each patient were collected every month after omalizumab (P11, P36 and P42) or placebo (P7, P37 and P38) treatment. The sera IgE levels were measured by ELISA using polyclonal goat anti-human IgE as the capture antibody and HRP-goat anti-human IgE as the detection antibody., 6 months",,"University of California, Davis",,ALL,ADULT,PHASE4,6,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: CROSSOVER|Masking: DOUBLE (PARTICIPANT, INVESTIGATOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",200312064,2004-02,2012-10-17,2012-10-17,2006-08-22,2017-12-05,2021-07-13,"UC Davis Department of Dermatology, Sacramento, California, 95816, United States",
