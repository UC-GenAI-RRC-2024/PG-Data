NCT00375713,Randomized Phase III Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Xyzal速 (Levocetirizine) vs Zyrtec速 (Cetirizine) in Subjects With Dermatitis and Eczema,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00375713,,COMPLETED,Korean double-blind non-inferiority study to asses the efficacy (as measured by the responder rate of pruritus severity score by the patient at visit 4 or end-of-treatment visit over the 2 weeks treatment period) and safety of Xyzal速 to Zyrtec速 in subjects suffering from dermatitis and eczema with pruritus symptoms,YES,Dermatitis|Eczema,DRUG: Levocetirizine|DRUG: Cetirizine|DRUG: Placebo-Levocetirizine|DRUG: Placebo-Cetirizine|DRUG: Standard topical steroid (1% hydrocortisone) ointment,"Responder Status According to Pruritus Severity Score (Response = Mild or None in Pruritus Severity Score)., A participant is a responder if the pruritus severity score is assessed as mild or none, otherwise it is a non-responder. The responder status is defined at day 14, except if the investigator assessed the subject as a responder at day 7. The Pruritus Score is in general defined as: 3 for Severe, 2 for Moderate, 1 for Mild and 0 for None., Day 7 and 14","Change From Baseline in the Mean Pruritus Severity Score at Endpoint During the 14 Day Treatment Period, The Pruritus Score Scale ranges from 0 to 3 (3 for Severe, 2 for Moderate, 1 for Mild and 0 for None). Endpoint is at visit 4 on day 14 or at an earlier timepoint at study completion., Baseline and at endpoint during the 14 day treatment period|Duration of Pruritus (Stated in Categories) at Endpoint During the 14 Day Treatment Period, Duration of pruritus was categorized as follows: 3 if \> 6 hours/24hr, 2 if 1 to 6 hours/24hr, 1 if less than 1 hour/24hr, and 0 if No pruritus. The endpoint is visit 4 on day 14 or at an earlier time point at study completion., At endpoint during the 14 day treatment period|Global Improvement at Endpoint During the 14 Day Treatment Period, Global improvement is measured on an ordered nominal scale ranging from marked improvement to exacerbation (see categories in the table).
