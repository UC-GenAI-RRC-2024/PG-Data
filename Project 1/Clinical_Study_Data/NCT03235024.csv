NCT03235024,Study to Determine Safety and Efficacy of B244 in Subjects With Mild to Moderate Atopic Dermatitis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03235024,,COMPLETED,"This is a Prospective, Vehicle Controlled, Double Blind, Multicenter, Randomized Phase II trial, comparing the effect of twice daily B244 application for 28 days vs vehicle application on treatment of mild to moderate AD",YES,Atopic Dermatitis Eczema,BIOLOGICAL: B244|BIOLOGICAL: Vehicle,"Number of Participants With Treatment-related Adverse Events as Assessed by CTCAE v4.0, Safety and tolerability endpoints will consist of all adverse events reporting during the study duration., Baseline to Day 42","Change in Eczema Area Severity Index (EASI) Score Between the Active and Vehicle Groups, EASI is a validated tool used to measure the severity and extent of atopic dermatitis where clinical investigators assess the presence and severity of erythema, edema/papulation, excoriation, and lichenification (score 0-3: none=0, mild=1, moderate=2, severe=3, half-points allowed) and area of involvement (score 0-6: 0=0% involvement, 1=1-9% involvement, 2=10-29% involvement, 3=30-49% involvement, 4=50-69% involvement, 5=70-89% involvement, 6=90-100% involvement) across head and neck, trunk (including the genital area), upper extremities, and lower extremities (including the buttocks). The EASI score can range from 0.0to 72.0 with increments of 0.1 and higher scores representing a greater severity of atopic dermatitis., Baseline to Day 28","Change in Visual Analog Scale (VAS) Score for Pruritus Between the Active and Vehicle Group, VAS (Visual Analog Scale) was performed as a measure of pruritus. The VAS is composed of a 10-cm line divided into a scale from 0 to 10, and subjects were to indicate the score that best represented the intensity of their itching over the 24-hour period before each visit where a higher score indicated greater severity in pruritus., Baseline to Day 28|Change in the Skindex 16 Score Between the Active and Vehicle Group, The Skindex 16 questionnaire was assigned to subjects to examine the relationship between the subject's skin health and quality of life. Subjects scored 16 questions from 0 to 6 (0=never bothered, 6=always bothered). Total scores could range between 0 to 96, where a higher score is associated with a worse quality of life., Baseline to Day 28|Change in the IGA Score Between the Active and Vehicle Groups, IGA (Investigator's Global Assessment) was used to assess the overall diseases severity on a scale of 0 to 4 (0=clear, 1=almost clear, 2=mild disease, 3=moderate disease, and 4=severe disease)., Baseline to Day 28|Difference in Actigraphy Scratching Event Count Per Hour During the Night Between the Active and Vehicle Group, Subjects were provided two Actigraphy watches (one on each wrist) to accurately monitor subject's sleep, activity, and itching patterns., Baseline to Day 28|Difference in Biomarkers Between Active and Vehicle Groups., To evaluate if B244 administration on the skin twice daily for 28 days will affect the levels of immune biomarkers., Baseline and Day 28|Microbial Content, Evaluate if B244 administration on skin twice daily will affect the microbial content on collected skin swab samples., Baseline and Day 28",AOBiome LLC,"Veristat, Inc.",ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE2,122,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: QUADRUPLE (PARTICIPANT, CARE_PROVIDER, INVESTIGATOR, OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",ADB244-001,2018-01-15,2019-02-27,2019-03-20,2017-08-01,2022-07-19,2022-10-10,"Central Research Associates, Birmingham, Alabama, 35205, United States|Elite Clinical Studies, Phoenix, Arizona, 85018, United States|Encino Research Center, Encino, California, 91436, United States|Orange County Research Center, Tustin, California, 92780, United States|Neostart Corporation d.b.a AGA Clinical Trials, Hialeah, Florida, 33012, United States|Clinical Neuroscience Solution, Inc, Jacksonville, Florida, 32256, United States|FXM Research Corp., Miami, Florida, 33175, United States|FXM Research Miramar, Miramar, Florida, 33027, United States|Clinical Neuroscience Solution, Inc, Orlando, Florida, 32801, United States|Clinical Research Trials of Florida, Inc., Tampa, Florida, 33607, United States|Columbus Regional Research Institute, Columbus, Georgia, 31904, United States|DeNova Research dba Arano, LLC, Chicago, Illinois, 60611, United States|Clarkston Skin Research, Clarkston, Michigan, 48349, United States|MediSearch Clinical Trials, Saint Joseph, Missouri, 64506, United States|LoveLace Scientific Resources, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87108, United States|Central Sooner Research, Norman, Oklahoma, 73071, United States|Paddington Testing Co., Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, 19103, United States","Study Protocol, https://storage.googleapis.com/ctgov2-large-docs/24/NCT03235024/Prot_000.pdf|Statistical Analysis Plan, https://storage.googleapis.com/ctgov2-large-docs/24/NCT03235024/SAP_001.pdf"
