NCT03831191,A Study of LY3375880 in Adults With Moderate-to-Severe Atopic Dermatitis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03831191,ADmIRe,TERMINATED,The reason for this study is to see if the study drug LY3375880 is safe and effective in adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD).,YES,Atopic Dermatitis,DRUG: LY3375880|DRUG: Placebo,"Percentage of Participants Achieving Validated Investigator's Global Assessment for AD (vIGA-AD) of 0 or 1 With a ≥2 Point Improvement, vIGA-AD measures participants' overall severity of their atopic dermatitis (AD), based on a static, numeric 5 point scale from 0 (clear) to 4 (severe). Higher scores indicate greater severity.The score is based on an overall assessment of the degree of erythema, papulation/induration, oozing/crusting, and lichenification. Non-responder imputation (NRI) method was used to impute missing data., Week 16","Percentage of Participants Achieving Eczema Area and Severity Index 75 (EASI-75), EASI assesses objective physician estimates of 2 dimensions of atopic dermatitis - disease extent and clinical signs - by scoring the extent of disease (percentage of skin affected: 0 = 0%; 1 = 1-9%; 2 = 10-29%; 3 = 30-49%; 4 = 50-69%; 5 = 70-89%; 6 = 90-100%) and the severity of 4 clinical signs (erythema, edema/papulation, excoriation, and lichenification) each on a scale of 0 to 3 (0 = none, absent; 1 = mild; 2 = moderate; 3 = severe) at 4 body sites (head and neck, trunk, upper limbs, and lower limbs). Half scores are allowed. Each body site will have a score that ranges from 0 to 72, and the final EASI score will be obtained by weight-averaging these 4 scores. Hence, the final EASI score will range from 0 to 72 (severe) for each time point. A higher score represented greater disease severity.The EASI75 is defined as a ≥ 75% improvement from baseline in the EASI score. Non-responder imputation (NRI) method was used to impute missing data., Week 16|Percentage of Participants Achieving SCORing Atopic Dermatitis 75 (SCORAD-75), The SCORAD index uses the rule of nines to assess disease extent (head and neck 9%; upper limbs 9% each; lower limbs 18% each; anterior trunk 18%; back 18%; and genitals 1%). It evaluates 6 clinical characteristics to determine disease severity: (1) erythema, (2) edema/papulation, (3) oozing/crusts, (4) excoriation, (5) lichenification, and (6) dryness on a scale of 0 to 3 (0=absence, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe). The SCORAD index also assesses subjective symptoms of pruritus and sleep loss in the last 72 hours on visual analogue scales (VAS) of 0 to 10 where 0 is no itch or sleep loss and 10 is worst imaginable itch or sleep loss. These 3 aspects: extent of disease, disease severity, and subjective symptoms combine to give a score between 0(no disease) and 103 (severe disease). Higher scores indicate greater severity.Non-responder imputation (NRI) method was used to impute missing data., Week 16|Percentage of Participants Achieving vIGA-AD of 0, vIGA-AD measures participants overall severity of their atopic dermatitis (AD), based on a static, numeric 5 point scale from 0 (clear) to 4 (severe). Higher scores indicate greater severity. The score is based on an overall assessment of the degree of erythema, papulation/induration, oozing/crusting, and lichenification. Non-responder imputation (NRI) method was used to impute missing data., Week 16|Mean Change From Baseline in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) Score, EASI assesses objective physician estimates of 2 dimensions of atopic dermatitis-disease extent and clinical signs-by scoring the extent of disease(percentage of skin affected: 0= 0%;1 =1-9%; 2 =10-29%;3 = 30-49%;4 = 50-69%;5 = 70-89%;6 = 90-100%) and the severity of 4 clinical signs (erythema,edema/papulation,excoriation,and lichenification) each on a scale of 0 to 3 (0 = none, absent; 1 =mild; 2 = moderate; 3=severe) at 4 body sites(head and neck,trunk,upper limbs,and lower limbs).Half scores are allowed.Each body site will have a score that ranges from 0 to 72,and the final EASI score will be obtained by weight-averaging these 4 scores.Hence,the final EASI score will range from 0 to 72(severe) for each time point.Higher scores indicate greater severity.Least Squares Mean(LS Means) were calculated using mixed model repeated measures(MMRM) with treatment,region, baseline disease severity,visit,treatment-by-visit-interaction,baseline and baseline-by-visit-interaction as fixed effects., Baseline, Week 16|Mean Change From Baseline in SCORAD, The SCORAD index uses the rule of nines to assess disease extent (head and neck 9%;upper limbs 9% each;lower limbs 18% each;anterior trunk 18%;back 18%;and genitals 1%).It evaluates 6 clinical characteristics to determine disease severity: (1)erythema,(2)edema/papulation, (3)oozing/crusts,(4) excoriation,(5) lichenification, and (6) dryness on a scale of 0 to 3(0=absence,1=mild,2=moderate,3=severe).The SCORAD index also assesses subjective symptoms of pruritus and sleep loss in the last 72 hours on visual analogue scales(VAS) of 0 to 10 where 0 is no itch or sleep loss and 10 is worst imaginable itch or sleep loss.These 3 aspects: extent of disease,disease severity,and subjective symptoms combine to give a score between 0(no disease) and 103(severe disease).Higher scores indicate greater severity. LS Means were calculated using a MMRM model with treatment,region,baseline disease severity,visit, treatment-by-visit-interaction,baseline and baseline-by-visit-interaction as fixed effects., Baseline, Week 16|Percentage of Participants Achieving vIGA-AD of 0 or 1 With a >=2-point Improvement at Week 52, vIGA-AD measures participants overall severity of their atopic dermatitis (AD), based on a static, numeric 5 point scale from 0 (clear) to 4 (severe). Higher scores indicate greater severity. The score is based on an overall assessment of the degree of erythema, papulation/induration, oozing/crusting, and lichenification.
