NCT03050294,Evaluating Treatment Resistant Dermatitis TaroIIR,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03050294,,COMPLETED,"Psoriasis and atopic dermatitis are chronic inflammatory disease that account for a significant amount of patients in most dermatological practices. Topical corticosteroid agents are often prescribed for treatment of both these conditions, especially when they are localized rather than wide spread. The development of resistance to treatment is termed tachyphylaxis. Poor adherence, rather than down regulation of receptors, may be the primary cause of tachyphylaxis to topical corticosteroids. The primary objective of the study is to determine, under conditions designed to assure good adherence, whether topical 0.25% desoximetasone spray improves clinical outcomes in patients who have resistant inflammatory skin disease defined by failure of previous topical steroid treatment.",YES,Atopic Dermatitis|Psoriasis,BEHAVIORAL: Phone calls|DRUG: Desoximetasone 0.25% spray,"Investigator Global Assessment- Atopic Dermatitis, Investigator's Global Assessment of atopic dermatitis integrates all lesions for overall score.

The score range is 0-15, with higher scores denoting worse outcomes., 1 week|Total Lesion Severity Score-Psoriasis, The total lesion severity score measures scaling, erythema, and plaque elevation. The score range is 0-15, with higher scores denoting worse outcomes., 2 weeks|Eczema Area and Severity Index- Atopic Dermatitis, Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI): Disease severity will be assessed by a physician with the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI). This measure is commonly used and well validated instrument of eczema severity. It is weighted for area in each of the four body regions (which differs for adults and children under 7) and scores erythema, excoriation, induration/papulation, and lichenification. The total scores range from 0-72. Higher scores represent more severe eczema., 1 week|Pruritus Visual Analog Scale- Atopic Dermatitis, The Pruritus VAS is a scale consisting of a 10cm long line and a single question. The left end point represents ""no itch"" (score of 0) and the right end point the ""worst imaginable itch"" (score of 10)., 1 week|Pruritus Visual Analog Scale- Psoriasis, The Pruritus VAS is a scale consisting of a 10cm long line and a single question. The left end point represents ""no itch"" (score of 0) and the right end point the ""worst imaginable itch"" (score of 10)., 2 weeks|Psoriasis Area and Severity Index, The Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) is an index used to express the severity of psoriasis. It combines the severity (erythema, induration and desquamation) and percentage of affected areas (head, arms, trunk, and legs). The severity of three clinical signs (erythema, induration and desquamation) are on a scale from 0 to 4 (from absent to very severe). An area and severity score for each region is calculated by multiplying the area score by the severity score. The score range is 0-72, with higher scores denoting worse outcomes., 2 weeks",,Wake Forest University Health Sciences,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE4,24,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,IRB00039302,2017-02-01,2017-06-01,2017-06-01,2017-02-10,2018-05-16,2020-05-20,"Wake Forest University Health Sciences Department of Dermatology, Winston-Salem, North Carolina, 27157, United States","Study Protocol and Statistical Analysis Plan, https://storage.googleapis.com/ctgov2-large-docs/94/NCT03050294/Prot_SAP_000.pdf"
