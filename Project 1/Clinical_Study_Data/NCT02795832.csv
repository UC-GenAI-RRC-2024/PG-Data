NCT02795832,A Study to Determine the Safety & Efficacy of ZPL-5212372 in Healthy Subjects and in Subjects With Atopic Dermatitis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02795832,,COMPLETED,"A Randomised, Adaptive Design, Double-Blind (3rd Party Open), Placebo Controlled, Sequential Group Study to Determine the Safety,Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics and Efficacy of Twice Daily Application of a Topical ZPL-5212372 (1.0% w/w) Ointment Administered for up to 2 Weeks in Adult Healthy Volunteers and Patients with Moderate to Severe Atopic Dermatitis",YES,Atopic Dermatitis,DRUG: ZPL-5212372 1% w/w Ointment BID|DRUG: Placebo Ointment BID,"Percent Change From Baseline in EASI Score in Cohort 3, The EASI is a validated tool used to measure the severity and extent of atopic eczema (Eczema Area and Severity Index). The body is divided into 4 sections of total skin area: head including neck (10%); arms including extremities (20%); trunk (30%) and legs including extremities (40%). Each area is scored and the 4 scores are combined into the final EASI. The severity parameters are measured on a scale of 0 to 3 (from none to severe). For each section, the percentage area of skin involved with eczema is estimated and transformed into an extent grade from 0 to 6, from 0% of involved skin area with eczema to 90-100% of involved skin area with eczema. The sum of all four severity parameters is calculated for each section of skin and then multiplied by the weight of the respective section. This value is then multiplied by the extent score for that body area. The EASI value can range from 0-72, a higher score indicates more severe disease., Day 1 and Day 14|Percent Change From Baseline in EASI Score Over Time in Cohort 3 - Observed Case, The EASI is a validated tool used to measure the severity and extent of atopic eczema (Eczema Area and Severity Index). The body is divided into 4 sections of total skin area: head including neck (10%); arms including extremities (20%); trunk (30%) and legs including extremities (40%). Each area is scored and the 4 scores are combined into the final EASI. The severity parameters are measured on a scale of 0 to 3 (from none to severe). For each section, the percentage area of skin involved with eczema is estimated and transformed into an extent grade from 0 to 6, from 0% of involved skin area with eczema to 90-100% of involved skin area with eczema. The sum of all four severity parameters is calculated for each section of skin and then multiplied by the weight of the respective section. This value is then multiplied by the extent score for that body area. The EASI value can range from 0-72, a higher score indicates more severe disease., Days 1, 5, 8, 10, and 15","Summary of EASI-50 and EASI-75 Responders at Week 2 - Cohort 3, The proportion of subjects who achieved EASI-50 and EASI-75 responses at Week 2 were compared between treatment groups.

EASI-50 was defined as a ≥50% reduction from baseline in EASI score at Week 2. EASI-75 was defined as a ≥75% reduction from baseline in EASI score at Week 2., Day 14|Percentage of Responders on Investigators Global Assessment in Cohort 3, The following secondary endpoints were assessed for IGA:

A subject was considered as having IGA success if they achieved a score of 'Clear' or 'Almost clear'; note, as subjects required a score of ≥3 to enter the study they must have had a reduction of ≥2 from baseline to achieve success A subject was considered as having an IGA response if they achieved a score of 'Clear' or 'Almost clear', or a reduction of ≥2 from baseline IGA was summarized for the FAS with counts and percentages by treatment at each visit., Day 14|Change From Baseline in NRS for Pruritus at Week 2 - Observed Case in Cohort 3, Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) for Pruritus (worst itch). The Pruritus NRS is an assessment tool that will be used to assess the subject's worst itch as a result of AD in the previous 24 hours.

They will be asked the following question:

On a scale of 0 (No Itching) to 10 (Itching as bad as you can imagine), please rate the WORST itching that you felt over the last 24 hours., Day 1 to day 14|Summary of Patient Global Impression of Change and Logistic Regression of Patient Global Impression of Change in Cohort 3, Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) The PGIC scores were summarised for the FAS with counts and percentages in each treatment group. All data collected were included.

The PGIC was dichotomized into responders, defined as responses of 'Very Much Improved', 'Much Improved' or 'Minimally improved' and non-responders (all other responses plus missing data)., End of treatment (day 15)|Change From Baseline in Body Surface Area at Week 2 - Observed Case in Cohort 3, Body Surface Area (BSA). The percentage BSA affected was summarised at each visit, including change from baseline, by treatment group, using the Full Analysis Set., Day 1 to day 14","ZPL-5212372 Cmax for Patients in Cohort 2, PK parameters for patients who had ointment applied over 40% BSA., Day 1, Day 7|ZPL-5212372 AUCt for Patients in Cohort 2, PK parameters for patients who had ointment applied over 40% BSA., Day 1, Day 7|ZPL-5212372 Trough Plasma Concentrations in Cohort 3, PK parameters for patients who had ointment applied over 40% BSA., Day 5, Day 8, Day 10, Day 15",Ziarco Pharma Ltd,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE1|PHASE2,53,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: QUADRUPLE (PARTICIPANT, CARE_PROVIDER, INVESTIGATOR, OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",Ziarcopharma,2016-06,2017-03-01,2017-03-01,2016-06-10,2018-02-23,2019-04-05,"MAC, Blackpool, United Kingdom|MAC, Leeds, United Kingdom|MAC, Manchester, United Kingdom","Statistical Analysis Plan, https://storage.googleapis.com/ctgov2-large-docs/32/NCT02795832/SAP_000.pdf|Study Protocol, https://storage.googleapis.com/ctgov2-large-docs/32/NCT02795832/Prot_001.pdf"
