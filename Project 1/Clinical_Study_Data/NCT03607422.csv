A change in POEM score of 3.4 points is considered the minimal clinically important difference., Baseline and Week 16|Adolescents: Percentage of Participants Achieving a Reduction of ≥ 4 Points From Baseline in DLQI Score at Week 16, The DLQI is a 10-item validated questionnaire used to assess the impact of AD disease symptoms and treatment on quality of life (QoL). It consists of 10 questions evaluating impact of skin diseases on different aspects of a participant's QoL over the prior week, including symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure, work or school, personal relationships, and the side effects of treatment. Each item is scored on a 4-point scale (0 = not at all/not relevant; 1 = a little; 2 = a lot; and 3 = very much).

Item scores are added to provide a total score, ranging from 0 to 30, with higher scores indicating greater impairment of QoL.

the DLQI was administered to participants who were ≥ 16 (16 to 75) years old at the time of the Screening visit., Baseline and Week 16|Adolescents: Percent Change From Baseline in SCORAD Score at Week 16, SCORAD is a clinical tool used to assess the extent and severity of eczema (SCORing Atopic Dermatitis). The extent is assessed using the rule of 9 to calculate the affected area (A) as a percentage of the whole body (0-100%). The intensity part of the SCORAD (B) consists of 6 items: erythema, oedema/papulation, excoriations, lichenification, oozing/crusts and dryness, each graded on a scale from 0 (none) to 3 (severe), for a total score of 0 to 18. Subjective items (C) include daily pruritus and sleeplessness, each scored on a visual analogue scale (VAS) from 0 to 10 (total score 0-20). SCORAD is calculated as A/5 + 7B/2 + C, and ranges from 0 to 103 (worst). A negative change from Baseline indicates improvement., Baseline and Week 16|Adolescents: Percentage of Participants Achieving HADS-A Score and HADS-D Score of < 8 at Week 16, The HADS is a 14-item questionnaire, with seven items related to anxiety (HADS-A) and seven items related to depression (HADS-D). Each item is scored from 0 to 3; scores for each subscale range from 0 to 21, with higher scores indicating more distress. For each domain, scores 7 or lower are considered normal, 8 to 10 are borderline, and 11 or higher indicate clinical anxiety or depression., Week 16|Adolescents: Percentage of Participants Achieving a DLQI Score of 0 or 1 at Week 16, The DLQI is a 10-item validated questionnaire used to assess the impact of AD disease symptoms and treatment on quality of life (QoL). It consists of 10 questions evaluating impact of skin diseases on different aspects of a participant's QoL over the prior week, including symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure, work or school, personal relationships, and the side effects of treatment. Each item is scored on a 4-point scale (0 = not at all/not relevant; 1 = a little; 2 = a lot; and 3 = very much).

Item scores are added to provide a total score, ranging from 0 to 30, with higher scores indicating greater impairment of QoL. A score of 0 or 1 means that the disease has no effect at all.
