NCT03011892,A Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Ruxolitinib Phosphate Cream Applied Topically to Adults With Atopic Dermatitis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03011892,,COMPLETED,The purpose of this study is to establish the efficacy of each strength of ruxolitinib cream once daily (QD) or twice daily (BID) in participants with atopic dermatitis as compared with vehicle cream BID.,YES,Atopic Dermatitis,DRUG: Ruxolitinib 0.15% Cream QD|DRUG: Ruxolitinib 0.5% Cream QD|DRUG: Ruxolitinib 1.5% Cream QD|DRUG: Ruxolitinib 1.5% Cream BID|DRUG: Triamcinolone 0.1% Cream BID|DRUG: Vehicle Cream BID,"Mean Percentage Change From Baseline in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) Score at Week 4 in Participants Treated With Ruxolitinib 1.5% Cream Twice a Day (BID) Compared With Participants Treated With Vehicle Cream BID, EASI is a validated composite scoring system integrating the proportion of the body region (area) involved and the intensity of key signs of atopic dermatitis (AD). The EASI score examines 4 areas of the body and weights them for participants 8 years of age and older as follows: Head/Neck (H) = 0.1, Upper limbs (UL) = 0.2, Trunk (T) = 0.3, and Lower limbs (LL) = 0.4. The severity strata for the EASI are as follows: 0 = clear; 0.1 to 1.0 = almost clear; 1.1 to 7.0 = mild; 7.1 to 21.0 = moderate; 21.1 to 50.0 = severe; 50.1 to 72.0 = very severe. The total EASI score for each region is calculated by multiplying the severity score by the area score, with adjustment for the proportion of the body region to the whole body. The total EASI score ranges from 0 to 72. A higher score indicated worse disease status, and a negative change from baseline indicated improvement., Baseline and Week 4","Mean Percentage Change From Baseline in EASI Score at Week 4 in Participants Treated With Ruxolitinib QD Compared With Participants Treated With Vehicle Cream BID, EASI is a validated composite scoring system integrating the proportion of the body region (area) involved and the intensity of key signs of atopic dermatitis (AD).

The total EASI score ranges from 0 to 72. A higher score indicated worse disease status, and a negative change from baseline indicated improvement., Baseline and Week 4|Mean Percentage Change From Baseline in EASI Score at Week 2 and Week 8, EASI is a validated composite scoring system integrating the proportion of the body region (area) involved and the intensity of key signs of atopic dermatitis (AD). The EASI score examines 4 areas of the body and weights them for participants 8 years of age and older as follows: Head/Neck (H) = 0.1, Upper limbs (UL) = 0.2, Trunk (T) = 0.3, and Lower limbs (LL) = 0.4. The severity strata for the EASI are as follows: 0 = clear; 0.1 to 1.0 = almost clear; 1.1 to 7.0 = mild; 7.1 to 21.0 = moderate; 21.1 to 50.0 = severe; 50.1 to 72.0 = very severe.

The total EASI score ranges from 0 to 72. A higher score indicated worse disease status, and a negative change from baseline indicated improvement., Baseline, Week 2 and 8|Percentage of Participants Who Achieve a ≥ 50% Improvement From Baseline in EASI (EASI-50) at Weeks 2, 4, and 8, The categorical variable EASI-50 will be equal to 1 for percentage improvement from baseline in EASI score of 50% or greater and will be equal to 0 for percentage improvement of less than 50%. This definition is introduced for the purpose of identifying participants who respond to the treatment (1 = responder, 0 = non-responder)., Week 2, 4 and 8|Percentage Change From Baseline in EASI Score at Week 4, EASI is a validated composite scoring system integrating the proportion of the body region (area) involved and the intensity of key signs of atopic dermatitis (AD).

Therapeutic response was an IGA score of 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear). An IGA responder was defined as a participant achieving an IGA score of 0 to 1 and an IGA score improvement at least 2 from baseline., Week 2, 4 and 8|Mean Change From Baseline in the Itch Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) Score at Weeks 2, 4, and 8, The Itch NRS is a once-per-24 hours (""daily"") participant-reported measure of itch intensity to rate the itching severity because of their AD by selecting a number from 0 (no itch) to 10 (worst imaginable itch) that best describes their worst level of itching in the past 24 hours. The categorical NRS is defined as 0 = None, 1 to 3 = Mild, 4 to 6 = Moderate, and 7 to 10 = Severe., Baseline, Week 2, 4 and 8|Number of Participants With At Least One Adverse Event (AEs) and as Per Severity, AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related, that occurs after a participant provides informed consent.
