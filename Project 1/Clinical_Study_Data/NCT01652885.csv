Grades for classification of severity: 0= clear (minor residual discoloration, no erythema or induration or papulation, no oozing or crusting), 1= almost clear (trace faint pink erythema, with barely perceptible induration or papulation and no oozing or crusting), 2= mild (faint pink erythema with mild induration or papulation and no oozing or crusting), 3= moderate (pink-red erythema with moderate induration or papulation with or without oozing or crusting) and 4= severe (deep or bright red erythema with severe induration or papulation and with oozing or crusting). Treatment success was defined as ISGA score of 0 or 1, and a minimum improvement of 2 grades in ISGA from Baseline to Day 29., Baseline up to Day 29|Change From Baseline in Signs and Symptoms of Atopic Dermatitis at Day 8, 15, 22 and 29, 5 signs and symptoms of atopic dermatitis were: 1) erythema, 2) pruritus, 3) exudation, 4) excoriation and 5) lichenification. The severity of each of these 5 signs and symptoms were assessed on a 4 point scale, ranging from 0 (none) to 3 (severe). Higher scores (for each of the 5 signs and symptoms) indicate higher degree of severity of atopic dermatitis., Baseline, Day 8, 15, 22, 29",,Pfizer,,ALL,CHILD,PHASE1|PHASE2,23,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: NA|Intervention Model: SINGLE_GROUP|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,AN2728-AD-203|A3191007,2012-07,2012-10,2012-11,2012-07-30,2017-01-11,2017-04-24,"Anacor Investigational Site, Fremont, California, 94538, United States|Anacor Investigational Site, San Diego, California, 92123, United States|Anacor Investigational Site, Indianapolis, Indiana, 46256, United States|Anacor Investigational Site, High Point, North Carolina, 27262, United States|Anacor Investigational Site, Winston-Salem, North Carolina, 27104, United States|Anacor Investigational Site, Houston, Texas, 77030, United States",
