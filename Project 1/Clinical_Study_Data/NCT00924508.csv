An experienced evaluator assessed each lesion on the severity of 4 domains, with higher scores indicating more severity: 1) intensity of redness (erythema), 2) thickness (induration, papulation, oedema), 3) scratching (excoriation) and 4) lichenification (lined skin) as as none (0), mild (1), moderate (2) and severe (3).
