NCT00179959,The Impact of Treating Staphylococcus Aureus Infection and Colonization on the Clinical Severity of Atopic Dermatitis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00179959,,COMPLETED,"Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) infection is perceived not only as a common secondary complication of atopic dermatitis (AD), but also as a culprit in the worsening of this condition. In addition, the recent development of community acquired methicillin-resistant S. aureus (CA-MRSA) has presented a new challenge to our management of AD, both in treatment of acute infections and maintenance therapy. The investigators would like to perform a randomized investigator-blinded placebo-controlled study of children aged 6 months to 17 years with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis with clinical signs of secondary bacterial infection to study: 1) the prevalence of CA-MRSA in our patient population; 2) the relationship of sensitivity of the S. aureus organism cultured from the infected lesion(s) to clinical response to oral cephalexin therapy and severity of the AD; and 3) whether concurrent treatment of S. aureus infection initially with nasal mupirocin ointment and sodium hypochlorite (bleach) baths can result in long-term S. aureus eradication and clinical stability.",YES,Atopic Dermatitis,DRUG: Sodium hypochlorite (bleach) baths|DRUG: Mupirocin ointment|DRUG: Water|DRUG: Petrolatum Ointment,"Change in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI)Scores According to Location, The proportion of affected body surface area (BSA) was estimated from 4 designated body regions(head/neck, upper limbs, trunk, and lower limbs),and the Physician's Assessment of Individual Signs was determined for each region by grading signs of AD on a 4-point scale. Both the proportion of affected BSA and the Physician's Assessment of Individual Signs score were used to calculate the EASI score,a validated composite score that ranges from 0 (clear) to 72 (very severe)., Baseline and 3 months",,,Northwestern University,Society for Pediatric Dermatology|Johnson & Johnson,ALL,CHILD,PHASE4,31,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: DOUBLE (PARTICIPANT, INVESTIGATOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",12624,2005-09,2011-03,2011-03,2005-09-16,2011-04-04,2014-12-08,"Childrens Memorial Hospital, Chicago, Illinois, 60614, United States",
