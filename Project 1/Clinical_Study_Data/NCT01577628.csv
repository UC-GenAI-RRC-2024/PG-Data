NCT01577628,Daily Use of Lipikar Balm AP From Birth in Infants at High Risk of Developing Atopic Dermatitis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01577628,,TERMINATED,"There is a lack of prospective scientific data on the regular use of moisturizers in patients at risk of developing atopic dermatitis. Although generally accepted and widely used for secondary prevention, emollients have not been studied as a primary prevention strategy. Strategies previously studied for the prevention of atopic dermatitis include maternal and child's dietary manipulations, allergens avoidance, delay of food introduction, exclusive breastfeeding and probiotic supplementation. Despite years of research, none of those strategies yielded to strong evidence of a protective effect. There is therefore a need to explore novel strategies.

There is a need to compare the cumulative incidence rate of atopic dermatitis in newborns using a standard bathing and moisturizing routine with a good moisturizer to a non interventional group.

This 2-year study will recruit approximately four hundred and sixty (460) pregnant women with a first degree relative of the child to be born who currently has (or previously had) a diagnosis of atopic dermatitis in order to study approximately 200 eligible newborns in each of the two study groups at the beginning of the study.

Pregnant women will be randomized (1:1) to either daily use of the moisturizer Lipikar Balm AP (applied to their infant) starting from birth (Group 1) immediately after bathing or to no intervention (Group 2).",YES,Atopic Dermatitis|Eczema|Asthma|Food Allergies|Allergic Rhinitis,DRUG: Lipikar Balm AP,"Proportion of Infants Who Develop Atopic Dermatitis, Proportion of infants who develop atopic dermatitis at two years for infants randomized to Lipikar Balm AP as compared to infants randomized to the no intervention control group, 2 years","Proportion of Infants Who Develop Asthma, Proportion of infants who develop asthma at two years for infants randomized to Lipikar Balm AP as compared to infants randomized to the no intervention control group, 2 years|Proportion of Infants Who Develop a Food Allergy, Proportion of infants who develop a food allergy at two years for infants randomized to Lipikar Balm AP as compared to infants randomized to the no intervention control group, 2 years|Influence of the Presence of Mutation in the Filaggrin Gene on the Proportion of Infants Who Develop Atopic Dermatitis, Influence of the presence of mutation in the filaggrin gene on the proportion of infants who develop atopic dermatitis at two years for infants randomized to Lipikar Balm AP as compared to infants randomized to the no intervention control group, 2 years|Influence of the Presence of Mutation in the Filaggrin Gene on the Proportion of Infants Who Develop Asthma, Influence of the presence of mutation in the filaggrin gene on the proportion of infants who develop asthma at two years for infants randomized to Lipikar Balm AP as compared to infants randomized to the no intervention control group, 2 years|Influence of the Presence of Mutation in the Filaggrin Gene on the Proportion of Infants Who Develop a Food Allergy, Influence of the presence of mutation in the filaggrin gene on the proportion of infants who develop a food allergy at two years for infants randomized to Lipikar Balm AP as compared to infants randomized to the no intervention control group, 2 years|Time of Onset of Asthma in Infants, Time of onset of asthma in infants randomized to Lipikar Balm AP as compared to infants randomized to the no intervention control group, 2 years|Time of Onset of Food Allergy in Infants, Time of onset of food allergy in infants randomized to Lipikar Balm AP as compared to infants randomized to the no intervention control group, 2 years|Adverse Events (AEs) Collection, Adverse events (Skin AEs, asthma, food allergies, allergic rhinitis and any AE related to Lipikar Syndet, Lipikar Balm AP (group 1) or any other moisturizer application (group 2) will be collected., 2 years|Time of Onset of Atopic Dermatitis, Time of onset of atopic dermatitis in infants randomized to Lipikar Balm AP as compared to infants randomized to the no intervention control group, 2 years",,Cosmetique Active International,Innovaderm Research Inc.,FEMALE,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,2,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: PREVENTION,LRP11005,2012-06,2013-02,2013-02,2012-04-16,2016-02-23,2016-04-21,"Hamzavi Dermatology/Dermatology Specialists of Canton, Canton, Michigan, 48187, United States|Hamzavi Dermatology, Fort Gratiot, Michigan, 48059, United States|Lynderm Research, Markham, Ontario, L3P 1A8, Canada|Windsor Clinical Research, Windsor, Ontario, N8W 5L7, Canada",
