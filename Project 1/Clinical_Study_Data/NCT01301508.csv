NCT01301508,Efficacy and Safety of AN2898 and AN2728 Topical Ointments to Treat Mild-to-Moderate Atopic Dermatitis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01301508,,COMPLETED,The purpose of this study is to determine whether AN2898 and AN2728 ointments are safe and effective treatments for mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis (AD).,YES,"Dermatitis, Atopic","DRUG: AN2728 ointment, 2%|DRUG: AN2898 ointment, 1%|DRUG: AN2898 ointment vehicle|DRUG: AN2728 ointment vehicle","Atopic Dermatitis Severity Index (ADSI) Score at Baseline (Day 1), ADSI score was used to measure the severity of participant's atopic dermatitis (AD) affected lesion. It evaluated 5 signs of AD (erythema, pruritus, exudation, excoriation and lichenification) in each lesion. Each sign was rated by investigator on a scale of 0 (none) to 3 (severe), where higher score indicated more severe condition. Total ADSI score for each lesion was sum of scores of the 5 signs and ranged from 0 (none) to 15 (most severe), where higher score indicated more severe condition., Baseline (Day 1)|Atopic Dermatitis Severity Index (ADSI) Score at Day 14, ADSI score was used to measure the severity of participant's AD affected lesion. It evaluated 5 signs of AD (erythema, pruritus, exudation, excoriation and lichenification) in each lesion. Each sign was rated by investigator on a scale of 0 (none) to 3 (severe), where higher score indicated more severe condition. Total ADSI score for each lesion was sum of scores of the 5 signs and ranged from 0 (none) to 15 (most severe), where higher score indicated more severe condition., Day 14|Atopic Dermatitis Severity Index (ADSI) Score at Day 28, ADSI score was used to measure the severity of participant's AD affected lesion. It evaluated 5 signs of AD (erythema, pruritus, exudation, excoriation and lichenification) in each lesion. Each sign was rated by investigator on a scale of 0 (none) to 3 (severe), where higher score indicated more severe condition. Total ADSI score for each lesion was sum of scores of the 5 signs and ranged from 0 (none) to 15 (most severe), where higher score indicated more severe condition., Day 28|Atopic Dermatitis Severity Index (ADSI) Score at Day 42, ADSI score was used to measure the severity of participant's AD affected lesion. It evaluated 5 signs of AD (erythema, pruritus, exudation, excoriation and lichenification) in each lesion. Each sign was rated by investigator on a scale of 0 (none) to 3 (severe), where higher score indicated more severe condition. Total ADSI score for each lesion was sum of scores of the 5 signs and ranged from 0 (none) to 15 (most severe), where higher score indicated more severe condition., Day 42|Percentage of Participants With Decrease From Baseline in Atopic Dermatitis Severity Index (ADSI) Score at Day 28, ADSI score was used to measure the severity of participant's AD affected lesion. It evaluated 5 signs of AD (erythema, pruritus, exudation, excoriation and lichenification) in each lesion. Each sign was rated by investigator on a scale of 0 (none) to 3 (severe), where higher score indicated more severe condition. Total ADSI score for each lesion was sum of scores of the 5 signs and ranged from 0 (none) to 15 (most severe), where higher score indicated more severe condition. Percentage of participants in whom the active lesion (ointment treated) achieved a greater decrease from baseline to Day 28 in ADSI as compared to vehicle lesion (vehicle treated) and, in whom the vehicle lesion (vehicle treated) achieved a greater decrease from baseline to Day 28 as compared to active lesion (ointment treated) were reported in this outcome measure., Baseline (Day 1), Day 28",,"Percentage of Participants With Decrease From Baseline in Atopic Dermatitis Severity Index (ADSI) Score at Day 14 and 42, ADSI score was used to measure the severity of participant's AD affected lesion.

The SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death, initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization, life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying), persistent or significant disability or incapacity, congenital anomaly. Treatment-emergent were events between first dose of study medication and up to the end of study treatment (Day 42) that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state.
