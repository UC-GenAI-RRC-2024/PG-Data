NCT02068352,A Study to Evaluate the Effectiveness and Safety of Topical OPA-15406 Ointment to Treat Participants With Atopic Dermatitis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02068352,,COMPLETED,The purpose of this study is to investigate the effectiveness and safety of 2 concentrations of OPA-15406 compared to vehicle in participants with atopic dermatitis (AD).,YES,Atopic Dermatitis,DRUG: OPA-15406|DRUG: Vehicle ointment,"Percentage of Participants With Success in the Overall Investigator's Global Assessment of Disease Severity (IGA) Score at Week 4 [Using Non-responder Imputation or Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF)], The IGA evaluation was performed by a certified rater. The IGA score, used to assess the overall disease severity, consists of a 6-point severity scale from clear to very severe disease (0 = clear, 1 = almost clear, 2 = mild disease, 3 = moderate disease, 4 = severe disease, and 5 = very severe disease). The IGA uses clinical characteristics of erythema, infiltration, papulation, oozing, and crusting as guidelines for the overall severity assessment. The IGA assessment was performed for the overall selected treatment area(s): overall percentage body surface area to be treated and additionally for the target lesion. Success was defined as a score of 0 or 1 with at least a 2-grade reduction from Baseline. Participants without IGA score at Week 4 were treated as non-responders. In the sensitivity analysis, missing IGA score at Week 4 was imputed using LOCF method first and the success was defined based on the imputed IGA score., Week 4","Change From Baseline in Overall IGA Score at Week 4 [Using Mixed Model Repeated Measures (MMRM) Analysis], The IGA evaluation was performed by a certified rater. The IGA allows for an assessment of overall disease severity at a given time point, and it consists of a 6-point severity scale from clear to very severe disease (0 = clear, 1 = almost clear, 2 = mild disease, 3 = moderate disease, 4 = severe disease, and 5 = very severe disease). The IGA uses clinical characteristics of erythema, infiltration, papulation, oozing, and crusting as guidelines for the overall severity assessment. The IGA assessment was performed for the overall selected treatment area(s): overall percentage body surface area to be treated and additionally for the target lesion. A negative change from Baseline indicates improvement in overall IGA score., Baseline, Week 4|Change From Baseline in Overall IGA Score at Week 4 [Using Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) Analysis], The IGA allows for an assessment of overall disease severity at a given time point, and it consists of a 6-point severity scale from clear to very severe disease (0 = clear, 1 = almost clear, 2 = mild disease, 3 = moderate disease, 4 = severe disease, and 5 = very severe disease). The IGA uses clinical characteristics of erythema, infiltration, papulation, oozing, and crusting as guidelines for the overall severity assessment. Missing overall IGA scores at Week 4 were imputed using LOCF method. A negative change from Baseline indicates improvement in overall IGA score., Baseline, Week 4|Percentage of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs), An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related. An serious adverse event (SAE) was defined as any event which resulted in death, was life-threatening, was a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, required in-patient hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization, was a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or was another medically significant event., From signing of informed consent through Week 8","Percentage of Participants With Success in the Overall IGA Score at Week 8 (Using Non-responder Imputation or LOCF Imputation), IGA evaluation was performed by a certified rater. The IGA consists of a 6-point severity scale from clear to very severe disease (0 = clear, 1 = almost clear, 2 = mild disease, 3 = moderate disease, 4 = severe disease, and 5 = very severe disease). The IGA uses clinical characteristics of erythema, infiltration, papulation, oozing, and crusting as guidelines for the overall severity assessment. The IGA assessment was performed for the overall selected treatment area(s): overall percentage body surface area to be treated and additionally for the target lesion. Success was defined as a score of 0 or 1 with at least a 2-grade reduction from Baseline. In the primary analysis, participants without IGA score available at Week 8 were treated as non-responders. In the sensitivity analysis, the missing IGA score at Week 8 was imputed using LOCF method first and the success was defined based on the imputed IGA score., Week 8|Change From Baseline in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) Score (Using MMRM Analysis), The EASI evaluation assesses the extent of disease at 4 body sites and measures 4 clinical signs: (1) erythema, (2) induration/papulation, (3) excoriation, and (4) lichenification, each on a scale from 0 (no disease) to 3 (very severe). The EASI scale allows for a maximum score of 72. The EASI assessment was performed on overall body. A negative change from Baseline indicates improvement in EASI score., Baseline, Weeks 4 and 8|Change From Baseline in EASI Score (Using LOCF Analysis), The EASI evaluation assesses the extent of disease at 4 body sites and measures 4 clinical signs: (1) erythema, (2) induration/papulation, (3) excoriation, and (4) lichenification, each on a scale from 0 (no disease) to 3 (very severe). The EASI scale allows for a maximum score of 72. The EASI assessment was performed on overall body. A negative change from Baseline indicates improvement in EASI score., Baseline, Weeks 4 and 8|Change From Baseline in Visual Analog Scale (VAS) Score for Pruritus (Using MMRM Analysis), At each evaluation, the participants were asked to record their current pruritus intensity over their body overall, not just within the selected treatment areas\[s\] (i.e., intensity over the last 24 hours) on a horizontal 100-mm line marked as ""No itch"" on the left end and ""Worst imaginable itch"" on the right end. The VAS assessment was performed on the overall impression of itch on the body and not just for the selected treatment area(s) or for the target lesion. A negative change from Baseline indicates improvement in VAS score., Baseline, Weeks 4 and 8|Change From Baseline in VAS for Pruritus (Using LOCF Analysis), At each evaluation, the participants were asked to record their current pruritus intensity over their body overall, not just within the selected treatment areas\[s\] (i.e., intensity over the last 24 hours) on a horizontal 100-mm line marked as ""No itch"" on the left end and ""Worst imaginable itch"" on the right end. The VAS assessment was performed on the overall impression of itch on the body and not just for the selected treatment area(s) or for the target lesion.
