NCT03575871,Study Evaluating Efficacy and Safety of PF-04965842 in Subjects Aged 12 Years And Older With Moderate to Severe Atopic Dermatitis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03575871,JADE Mono-2,COMPLETED,"B7451013 is a Phase 3 study to evaluate PF-04965842 in patients aged 12 years and older with a minimum body weight of 40 kg who have moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. The efficacy and safety of two dosage strengths of PF-04965842, 100 mg and 200 mg taken orally once daily, will be evaluated relative to placebo over 12 weeks of study participation.
