NCT03250624,Safety and Efficacy of CD5024 0.3% Cream in Subjects With Atopic Dermatitis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03250624,,COMPLETED,"Exploratory, multi-centric, randomized, vehicle-controlled, investigator-blind, parallel group study, involved participants with chronic lesions of Atopic Dermatitis (AD) to evaluate the local and systemic safety of CD5024 0.3% cream over a 6-week treatment period compared to its vehicle.",YES,Atopic Dermatitis,DRUG: CD5024 0.3% cream|DRUG: Placebo,"Change From Baseline in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) Score at Day 43, The EASI score was used to measure the severity and extent of atopic dermatitis (AD) and measures erythema, induration, excoriation and lichenification on 4 anatomic regions of the body: head, trunk, upper and lower extremities. The total EASI score ranges from 0 (minimum) to 72 (maximum), with the higher scores indicated the worse severity of AD. All missing values were imputed by Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF)., Baseline, Day 43","Percent Change From Baseline in EASI at Each Visit, The EASI score was used to measure the severity and extent of atopic dermatitis (AD) and measures erythema, induration, excoriation and lichenification on 4 anatomic regions of the body: head, trunk, upper and lower extremities. The total EASI score ranges from 0 (minimum) to 72 (maximum) points, with the higher scores indicated the worse severity of AD. All missing values were imputed by LOCF., Baseline, Days 8,15, 22, 29, 36 and 43|Percentage of Participants Who Achieved an Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) Score of 1 (Almost Clear) or 0 (Clear), IGA scale consisted of 5 grades (0-4) among which 0 = Clear (Minor, residual discoloration, no erythema or induration/papulation, no oozing/crusting), 1 = Almost clear (Trace, faint pink erythema with almost no induration/papulation and no oozing/crusting), 2 = Mild (Faint pink erythema with mild induration/papulation and no oozing/crusting), 3 = Moderate (Pink-red erythema with moderate induration/papulation and there may be some oozing/crusting.), 4 = Severe (Deep/bright red erythema with severe induration/papulation with oozing/crusting). Success rate was defined as percentage of participants who achieved an IGA score of 1 (almost clear) or 0 (Clear) at specified visits. All missing values were imputed by LOCF., Days 8, 15, 22, 29, 36 and 43|Percent Change From Baseline in Total Sum Score (TSS) at Each Visit, The TSS was the sum of individual clinical severity scores for 5 signs of AD (erythema, induration/papulation, oozing/crusting, excoriation and lichenification). The severity of each sign was evaluated by using a 4-graded scale (0: none; 1: mild; 2: moderate; 3: severe). The total score ranges from 0 to 15, where higher score indicated worse severity of AD. All missing values were imputed by LOCF., Baseline, Days 8, 15, 22, 29, 36 and 43|Percent Change From Baseline in Modified Objective Scoring Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) at Each Visit, SCORAD index uses the rule of nines to assess disease extent and evaluates 6 clinical characteristics to determine disease severity: (1) erythema, (2) edema/papulation, (3) oozing/crusts, (4) excoriation, (5) lichenification, and (6) dryness on a scale of 0 to 3 (0=absence, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe). The SCORAD index also assesses subjective symptoms of pruritus and sleep loss with visual analog scale (VAS) where 0 is no itching or no trouble sleeping and 10 is unbearable itching or a lot of trouble sleeping. These 3 aspects: extent of disease (A: 0-1-2), disease severity (B: 0-18), \& subjective symptoms (C: 0-20) combine using A/5 + 7\*B/2+ C to give a maximum possible score of 103, where 0 = no disease and 103 = severe disease. Higher scores indicated worse outcome. All missing values were imputed by LOCF., Baseline, Days 8, 15, 22, 29, 36 and 43|Change From Baseline in Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) at Each Visit, Pruritus NRS was a scale that was used by the participants to report the intensity of their pruritus (itch) during the last 24 hours. For maximum itch intensity: the scores were provided on a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 = 'no itch' and 10 = 'worst itch imaginable', where higher score indicated very severe itch. All missing values were imputed by LOCF., Baseline, Weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6|Change From Baseline in Pruritus Verbal Rating Scale (VRS) Score at Day 43, Participants were asked for a response that best described their pruritus intensity in last 24 hours, to rate their itch using a list of adjectives describing different levels of symptom intensity rated on a scale of 0 to 3 that is (i.e.) 0 = No itch, 1 = low, 2 = Moderate and 3 = Severe, where higher score indicated very severe itch.
